A Tale of the Fall of Athens.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>A NEW PLAY.</small></h2>


<p>It is the second year of the ninety-third Olympiad<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and the Theatre at Athens is full, for the great dramatic
season is at its height, and to-day there is to be performed
a new play by Aristophanes, the special favorite of the
Athenian public. It is a brilliant scene, but a keen observer,
who happened to see the same gathering some five
and twenty years ago, must now notice a certain falling
off in its splendor. For these five and twenty years
have been years of war, and latterly, years of disaster.
Eleven years ago, the City wild with the pride of power
and wealth, embarked on the mad scheme of conquering
Sicily, and lost the finest fleet and army that it
ever possessed. Since then it has been a struggle for life
with it, and year by year it has been growing weaker and
weaker. This has told sadly on the glories of its great festivals.
The furnishing of the stage, indeed, is as perfect as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
ever, and the building itself has been pushed on several
stages towards completion.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> However scarce money may
be in the public treasury, the theatre must not be starved.
But elsewhere there are manifest signs of falling off. The
strangers&rsquo; gallery is almost empty. All the Greek world
from Massilia in Gaul to Cyrene among the sands of Africa
used to throng it in happier days. Now more than half
that world is hostile, and the rest has little to hope or fear
from the dispossessed mistress of the seas. Dionysius of
Syracuse, has sent an embassy, and the democracy, which
once would have treated with scant courtesy the representatives
of a tyrant, is fain to flatter so powerful a prince.
There are some Persian Envoys too, for the Persians are
still following their old game of playing off one great state
against another. A few Greeks from Sinope and from one
of the Italian cities, persons of no importance, who would
hardly have found a place in the gallery during the palmy
times of Athens, make up the company of visitors. Look
at the body of the theatre, where the citizens sit, and the
spectacle is deplorable indeed. The flower of Athens&rsquo; sons
has perished, and their successors are puny and degenerate.
Examine too the crowd that throngs the benches,
and you will see that the slaves, distinguished by their unsleeved
tunics, fill up no small portion of space. And boys
form an unusually large proportion of the audience. Altogether
the theatre is a dispiriting sight to a patriotic
Athenian.</p>

<p>To-day, however, all is gaiety, for, as has been said, there
is a new play to be brought out, and an Athenian must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
in desperate straits indeed, if he cannot forget his sorrows
at a new play.</p>

<p>When the curtain rises, or rather, is withdrawn, as the
Greek arrangement was, into an opening in the floor of the
stage, a murmur of recognition runs through the audience.
The scene is the market place of Thebes, and a familiar
figure occupies the foreground.</p>

<p>The portly figure, the ruddy face, the vine-leaf crown,
and the buskins show him to be Bacchus, the patron-god,
it will be remembered, of the Drama. But why this lion&rsquo;s
skin and club? The god gives a lordly kick at the door of
the house which was one of the familiar stage-properties,
and Hercules appears. He roars with laughter to see his
own emblems in such strange company. Bacchus explains.
&ldquo;The tragic poets grow worse and worse. There is not one
who can write a decent line. I am going down to the
regions of the dead to fetch Euripides,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and thought that
I had better dress myself up in your fashion, for you, I
know, made this same journey very successfully. Perhaps
you will tell me something about the way, and what inns
you can recommend, where they are free from fleas, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Don&rsquo;t try to dissuade me; but tell me the
way, which must not be either too hot or too cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well there is the Hanging way, by the sign of the Rope
and Noose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too stifling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a very short cut by the Mortar and Pestle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hemlock road,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too cold and wintry for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I&rsquo;ll tell you of a quick road and all downhill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent! for I am not a good walker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the tower in the Cemetery? Well; climb up
to the top when the Torch race is going to begin; and when
the people cry out &lsquo;start,&rsquo; start yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean &lsquo;start&rsquo;? Start from where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, start down from the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, and dash my brains out? No, not for me, thank
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it is settled that Bacchus and his slave, for he has a
slave with him to carry his baggage, shall take the usual
route by the Styx.</p>

<p>To the Styx, accordingly, they make their way. Charon
the ferryman is plying for hire, &ldquo;Any one for Rest-from-toil-and-labor
Land? For No-Mansland? For the Isle
of Dogs?<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bacchus steps in, and by Charon&rsquo;s order, takes an oar
which he handles very helplessly. The slave has to go
round: Charon does not carry slaves, he says. As they
slowly make their way across, the frogs from the marsh raise
the song of their kind, ending with the burden which is
supposed to represent their note, <i>Brekekekex, coax, coax</i>.</p>

<p>It is pitch dark on the further side. When the slave
turns up, he advises his master to go on at once. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
very spot,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;where Hercules told us those terrible
wild beasts were.&rdquo; Bacchus is very valiant.</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;A curse upon him! &rsquo;twas an idle tale,<br />
He feigned to frighten me, for well he knew,<br />
How brave I am, the envious braggart soul!<br />
Grant, fortune, I may meet some perilous chance<br />
Meet for so bold a journey.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Master, I hear a noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where, where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is behind us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get behind then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;it is in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go in front?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Master, I see such a Monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! it keeps on changing&mdash;now it&rsquo;s a bull, now it&rsquo;s a
stag, and now it&rsquo;s a woman; and its face is all fire. What
shall we do? O Hercules, Hercules help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue. Don&rsquo;t call me Hercules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bacchus, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; Bacchus is worse than Hercules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The travellers pass these dangers, and reach the palace
of Pluto. Bacchus knocks at the door. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
cries &AElig;acus the porter. &ldquo;The valiant Hercules,&rdquo; says
Bacchus. The name calls forth a torrent of reproaches, and
threats. Hercules was only too well remembered there.</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;O villain, villain, doubly, trebly dyed!<br />
&rsquo;Twas thou didst take our dog, our guardian dog,<br />
Sweet Cerberus, my charge. But, villain, now<br />
We have thee on the hip. For thee the rocks<br />
Of Styx, and Acheron&rsquo;s dripping well of blood,<br />
And Hell&rsquo;s swift hounds encompass.&rdquo;<br />
</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that dreadful voice?&rdquo; says Bacchus to the
slave. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it frighten you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frighten me? No, I didn&rsquo;t give it a thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a bold fellow. I say; suppose you become
me, and I become you. Take the club and the lion skin,
and I&rsquo;ll carry the baggage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They change parts accordingly. No sooner is this done,
than a waiting maid of Queen Proserpine appears. &ldquo;My
dear Hercules,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;come with me. As soon as my
mistress heard of your being here she had a grand baking,
made four or five gallons of soup, and roasted an ox whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; cries the false Hercules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t take a refusal. And, hark you! there&rsquo;s <i>such</i>
wine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted. Boy, bring along the baggage
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; cries the &ldquo;boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it was a joke
of mine, dressing you up as Hercules? Come, hand over
the club and the skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going to take the things away when you
gave me them yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I am: a pretty Hercules you would be. Come,
hand them over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; if I must, I must. But I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you
were sorry for it sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It turns out to be sooner rather than later. As soon as
the exchange is made, two landladies appear on the scene.
Hercules had committed other misdemeanors besides
stealing the dog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First Landlady.</i> &ldquo;This is the villain. He came to my
house, and ate sixteen loaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The Slave</i> (aside). &ldquo;Some one is getting into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>First Landlady.</i> &ldquo;Yes, and twenty fried cutlets at three-half-pence
apiece.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The Slave</i> (aside). &ldquo;Some one will suffer for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>First Landlady.</i> &ldquo;Yes, and any quantity of garlic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bacchus.</i> &ldquo;Woman this is all rubbish. I don&rsquo;t know
what you are talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>First Landlady.</i> &ldquo;Ah! you villain, because you have
buskins on, you thought I should not know you&mdash;and then
there was the salt-fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Second Landlady.</i> &ldquo;Yes, and the fresh cheeses which he
ate, baskets and all; and when I asked him for the money
he drew his sword, and we ran up, you remember, into the
attic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The Slave.</i> &ldquo;That is just the man. That&rsquo;s how he goes
on everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The angry women run off to fetch their lawyers; and
Bacchus begins again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, I am very fond of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you are after. Say no more; I&rsquo;m not going
to be Hercules; &lsquo;A pretty Hercules I should make,&rsquo; you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that you&rsquo;re angry. But do take the
things again. The gods destroy me and mine, root and
branch, if I rob you of them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; I&rsquo;ll take them, but mind, you have sworn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the exchange is made again.</p>

<p>Then &AElig;acus with his infernal policemen appears on the
scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow who stole the dog,&rdquo; he cries to his
men, &ldquo;seize him,&rdquo; while the false slave murmurs aside,
&ldquo;Some one is getting into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I steal your dog!&rdquo; says the false Hercules. &ldquo;I have
never been here, much less stolen the worth of a cent. But
come. I&rsquo;ll make you a fair offer. Here&rsquo;s my slave. Take
him, and put him to the torture, and if you get anything
out of him against me, then cut my head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fair,&rdquo; says &AElig;acus; &ldquo;and of course, if I do him any
damage, I shall pay for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind about the damage; torture away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; shouts Bacchus, as the policemen lay hold of
him, &ldquo;I warn you not to torture me, I&rsquo;m a god.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&AElig;acus.</i> &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bacchus.</i> &ldquo;I am Bacchus, son of Zeus, and that fellow
there is my slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&AElig;acus</i> (to the false Bacchus) &ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The false Bacchus.</i> &ldquo;Say? Lay on the lash; if he&rsquo;s a god,
of course he can&rsquo;t feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bacchus.</i> &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a god too, you say. So you won&rsquo;t
mind taking blow for blow with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The false Bacchus.</i> &ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo; (To &AElig;acus) &ldquo;Lay on, and
the first that cries out, you may be sure he&rsquo;s not the real god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the trial takes place. Both bear it bravely, till at last
&AElig;acus cries in perplexity. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out. I don&rsquo;t
know which is which. Well, you shall both come to my
master and Queen Proserpine. They&rsquo;re gods, and they
ought to know their own kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bacchus.</i> &ldquo;An excellent idea; I only wish that you had
thought of it before you gave me that beating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things are now supposed to be set right. Bacchus goes
to dine with Pluto and Proserpine; the slave is entertained
by &AElig;acus in the servants&rsquo; hall. While they are talking a
tremendous uproar is heard outside; and &AElig;acus explains to
his guest that it is a rule in their country that the best poet
or writer or artist should have a seat at the King&rsquo;s table and
a place at the King&rsquo;s right hand. This honor &AElig;schylus
had held as the first of the tragic poets, but when Euripides
came, all the crowd of pick-pockets and burglars and
murderers, who were pretty numerous in these parts, had
been so delighted with his twists and turns, that they were
for giving him the first place; and on the strength of their
support he had claimed the tragic throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But had not &AElig;schylus any friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, among the respectable people; but respectable
people are scarce down here, as they are up above.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Sophocles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! as soon as he came, he went up to &AElig;schylus and
kissed him on the cheek, and took him by the hand. He
yielded the throne, he said, to &AElig;schylus; but if Euripides
came off best, he should contest it with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is going to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be a trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is to be judge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s the difficulty. Wise men, you see, are not
so plenty. Even with the Athenians &AElig;schylus didn&rsquo;t get
on very well. However they have made your master judge.
He is supposed to know all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have tried to give some idea of the first, the farcical half
of the play. It is possible to appreciate the fun, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
much of its flavor has evaporated, and there are many
strokes of humor which, for one reason or another, it has
not been possible to reproduce. The second half is a series
of subtle literary criticisms on the language, style, dramatic
construction, and ruling sentiment of the two poets. No
one can appreciate it who is not familiar with their works;
no version is possible that would give any that idea of it.
One specimen I shall attempt. &AElig;schylus finds fault with
the prosaic matter-of-fact character of his rival&rsquo;s opening
scenes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll spoil them all with a flask,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Go
on and repeat whichever you please.&rdquo; Euripides begins
with the opening lines of the Danaides (a play now lost).</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Aegyptus&mdash;so the common story runs&mdash;<br />
Crossed with his fifty sons the ocean plains,<br />
And reaching Argos&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">&ldquo;Lost a little flask.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">puts in &AElig;schylus.</p>

<p>He begins again with the opening lines of another</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Cadmus, Agenor&rsquo;s offspring, setting sail<br />
From Sidon&rsquo;s city&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&ldquo;Lost a little flask.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then he tries with the first lines of a third</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Great Bacchus, who with wand and fawn-skin decked,<br />
In pine-groves of Parnassus, plies the dance,<br />
And leads the revel&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&ldquo;Lost a little flask.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>The reader may have had enough. It will suffice to give
the result of the contest. All the tests have been applied.
Euripides, as a last resource, reminds the judge that he has
sworn to take him back with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Bacchus replies:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My tongue hath sworn; yet &AElig;schylus I choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cruel cut, for it is an adaptation of one of the poet&rsquo;s own
lines (from the Hippolytus) when the hero, taunted with
the oath that he had taken and is about to violate, replies:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My tongue hath sworn it, but my mind&rsquo;s unsworn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the curtain rose from the floor and hid the last
scene, it was manifest that the &ldquo;Frogs&rdquo; of Aristophanes,
son of Philippus, of the tribe Pandionis, and the township
Cydathen&aelig;a, was a success. Of course there were malcontents
among the audience. Euripides had a good many
partisans in young Athens. They admired his ingenuity,
his rhetoric, and the artistic quality of his verse, in which
beauty for beauty&rsquo;s sake, quite apart from any moral purpose,
seemed to be aimed at. They were captivated by the
boldness and novelty of his treatment of things moral and
religious. &AElig;schylus they considered to be old-fashioned
and bigoted. Hence among the seats allotted to the young
men there had been some murmurs of dissent while the
performance was going on, and now there was a good deal
of adverse criticism. And there were some among the older
men who were scarcely satisfied. The fact was that Comedy
was undergoing a change, the change which before twenty
more years had passed was to turn the Old Comedy into
the Middle and the New, or to put the matter briefly, to
change the Comedy of Politics into the Comedy of Manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is poor stuff,&rdquo; said an old aristocrat of this school,
&ldquo;poor stuff indeed, after what I remember in my younger
days. Why can&rsquo;t the man leave Euripides alone, especially
now he is dead, and won&rsquo;t bother us with any more of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
plays? There are plenty of scoundrel politicians who might
to much more purpose come in for a few strokes of the lash.
But he daren&rsquo;t touch the fellows. Ah! it was not always
so. I remember the play he brought out eighteen years
ago. The &lsquo;Knights&rsquo; he called it. That was something
like a Comedy! Cleon was at the very height of his power,
for he had just made that lucky stroke at Pylos<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. But
Aristophanes did not spare him one bit for that. He could
not get any one to take the part; he could not even get a
mask made to imitate the great man&rsquo;s face. So he took the
part himself, and smeared his face with the lees of wine.
Cleon was there in the Magistrates&rsquo; seats. I think we all
looked at him as much as we looked at the stage. Whenever
there was a hard hit&mdash;and, by Bacchus, how hard the
hits were!&mdash;all the theatre turned to see how he bore it. He
laughed at first. Then we saw him turn red and pale&mdash;I
was close by him and I heard him grind his teeth. Good
heavens! what a rage he was in! Well, that is the sort of a
play I like to see, not this splitting words, and picking
verses to pieces, just as some schoolmaster might do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, in spite of these criticisms, the greater part of the
audience were highly delighted with what they had seen
and heard. The comic business, with its broad and laughable
effects, pleased them, and they were flattered by being
treated as judges of literary questions. And the curious
thing was that they were not unfit to be judges of such
matters. There never was such a well-educated and keen-witted
audience in the world. They knew it, and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
dearly liked to be treated accordingly. The judges only
echoed the popular voice when at the end of the festival
they bestowed the first prize upon Aristophanes.</p>

<p>One criticism, strange to say, no one ever thought of making&mdash;and
yet, to us, it seems the first, the most obvious of
all criticisms, and that is that the play was horribly profane.
This cowardly, drunken, sensual Bacchus&mdash;and he is
ten times worse in the original than I have ventured to
make him here&mdash;this despicable wretch was one of the gods
whom every one in the audience was supposed to worship.
The festival which was the occasion of the theatrical exhibition
was held in his honor, his altar was the centre
round which the whole action of every piece revolved.
And yet he was caricatured in this audacious manner, and
it did not occur to anyone to object! Verily the religion of
the Greeks sat very lightly on their consciences, and we
cannot wonder if it had but small effect on their lives.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>NEWS FROM THE FLEET.</small></h2>


<p>I anticipated the course of my story when I spoke of the
first prize being adjudged to the comedy exhibited by
Aristophanes. There were various competing plays&mdash;how
many we do not know, but the titles and authors of two
that won the second and third prizes have been preserved&mdash;and
all those had of course to be performed before a decision
could be made. Two or three days at least must have passed
before the exhibition was at an end.</p>

<p>The next competitor had certainly reason to complain of
his ill-luck. Just before the curtain fell for the opening
scene of his comedy an incident occurred which made the
people little disposed to listen to anything more that day.
The spectators had just settled themselves in their places,
when a young officer hastily made his way up to the bench
where the magistrates were seated, and handed a roll to the
president. The occurrence was very unusual. It was
reckoned almost an impiety to disturb the festival of Bacchus
with anything of business; only matters of the very
gravest importance could be allowed to do it. The entrance
of the young man, happening as it did, just in the pause of
expectation before the new play began, had been generally
observed. Every one could see from his dress that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
a naval officer, and many knew him as one of the most
promising young men in Athens. &ldquo;News from the fleet,&rdquo;
was the whisper that ran through the theatre, and there
were few among the thousands there assembled to whom
news from the fleet did not mean the life or death of father,
brother, or son. The president glanced at the document
put into his hands, and whispering a few words to the messenger,
pointed to a seat by his side. All eyes were fastened
upon him. (The magistrates, it may be explained, occupied
one of the front or lowest rows of seats, and were therefore
more or less in view of the whole theater, which was arranged
in the form of a semicircle, with tier upon tier of
benches rising upon the slope of the hill on the side of which
the building was constructed.) When a moment afterwards,
the curtain was withdrawn, scarcely a glance was
directed to the stage. The action and the dialogue of the
new piece were absolutely lost upon what should have been
an audience, but was a crowd of anxious citizens, suddenly
recalled from the shows of the stage to the realities of
life.</p>

<p>The president now carefully read the document and passed
it on to his colleagues. Some whispered consultations passed
between them. When at the end of the first act a change
of scenery caused a longer pause than usual the president
quietly left the theatre, taking the bearer of the
despatch with him. Some of the other magistrates followed
him, the rest remaining behind because it would have
been unseemly to leave the official seats wholly untenanted
while the festival was still going on. This proceeding increased
the agitation of the people, because it emphasized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the importance of the news that had arrived. Some slipped
away, unable to sit quietly in their places and endure the
suspense, and vaguely hoping to hear something more outside.
Among those that remained the buzz of conversation
grew louder and louder. Only a few very determined
play-goers even pretended to listen to what was going on
upon the stage. Meanwhile the unfortunate author, to
whom, after all, the fate of his play was not less urgent a
matter than the fate of the city, sat upon his prompter&rsquo;s
stool&mdash;the author not uncomonly did the duty of prompter&mdash;and
heartily cursed the bad luck which had distracted in
so disastrous a way the attention of his audience.</p>

<p>When at last, to the great relief of everyone concerned,
the performance was brought to a conclusion, the young
officer told his story, supplementing the meagre contents of
the despatch which he had brought, to a full conclave of
magistrates, assembled in one of the senate-rooms of the
Prytaneum or Town-hall of Athens. I may introduce him
to my readers as Callias, the hero of my story.</p>

<p>Many of the details that follow had already been given by
Callias, but as he had to repeat them for the benefit of the
magistrates who had stopped behind in the theatre, I may
as well put them all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;that Conon was beaten
in a battle in the harbor of Mitylene. So much we heard
from Hippocles, a very patriotic person by the way,
though he is an alien. He has a very swift yacht that can
outstrip any war-ship in Greece, and often gives us very
valuable intelligence. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<span class="caption">THE THEATER OF DIONYSUS AT THE PRESENT DAY.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Callias, flushing with pleasure, for indeed he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
knew and respected Hippocles greatly, &ldquo;I know him very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to go on,&rdquo; resumed the president. &ldquo;So much we
know, but no more. Tell us exactly how Conon fared in
the battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the young man, &ldquo;he lost thirty ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the crews,&rdquo; asked the president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They escaped; happily they were able to get to land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Athene for that;&rdquo; and a murmur of relief ran
round the meeting. &ldquo;And the other forty&mdash;he had seventy,
I think, in all?&rdquo; Callias nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to the forty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were hauled up under the walls when the day
went against us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell us exactly what has been going on since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spartans blockaded the harbor, having some of
their ships within, and some without. Our general saw
that it was only a matter of time when he should have to
surrender. The Spartans had four times as many ships, the
ships not, perhaps, quite as good as his, but the crews, I am
afraid, somewhat better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shade of Themistocles,&rdquo; murmured one of the magistrates,
&ldquo;that it should come to this&mdash;the Spartan crews
&lsquo;somewhat better&rsquo; than ours. But I am afraid that it is
only too true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not break through; and could not stand a long
siege. Mitylene was fairly well provisioned for its ordinary
garrison, but here were seventy crews added all of a sudden
to the number. He sent some officers&mdash;I had the honor of
being one of them&mdash;and we found that by sparing everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to the very utmost, we might hold out for five weeks. The
only chance was to send news to Athens. You might help
us, we thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might; we <i>must</i>, I say. But how it is to be done is
another matter. Tell us how you got here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The general took the two fastest ships in his squadron,
manned them with the very best rowers that he could find,
practised the crews for four days in the inner harbor, and then
set about running the blockade with them. The Spartans,
you see, had grown a little careless. We hadn&rsquo;t made any
attempt to get out, and Conon got a Lesbian freedman to
desert to the Spartans with a story that we were meaning
to surrender. This put them off their guard still more.
They got into a way of leaving their ships at noon, to take
their meal and their siesta afterwards on shore. We made
a dart at an unguarded place between two of their blockading
ships and we got through. I don&rsquo;t think that we
lost a single man. By the time that the crews of the
blockading galleys regained their vessels we were well
out of bow-shot. Our instructions were to separate, when
we got outside the harbor. We did not do this at once because
we had planned a little trick which might, we hoped,
help to put the enemy off the scent. The ship that I was
in was really the swifter of the two. This was, of course,
the reason why I was put into it. But as long as we kept
together we made believe that we were the slower. When
they came out after us&mdash;they had manned half-a-dozen
ships or so as quickly as they could&mdash;we separated. My
ship, which you will understand, was really the faster of
the two, was put about the north as if making for Helles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>pont;
the other kept on its course, straight for Athens. The
Spartans told off their best ships to follow the latter which
they thought that they had the better chance of catching.
And of course, as it was headed this way, it seemed the
more important of the two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that they overtook it,&rdquo; said the president,
&ldquo;or it would have been here before this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we soon outstripped the two galleys that were
told to look after us. When we were well out of sight, we
headed westward again, took a circuit round the north side
of Lemnos, and got here without seeing another enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long is it since you left Mitylene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About five days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how long did Conon think he could hold out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About forty days; perhaps more, if the men were put on
short rations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done well, my son,&rdquo; said the president kindly,
&ldquo;and Athens will not forget it. We will consult together,
though there is small need of consulting, I take it. The relief
<i>must</i> be sent. Is it not so gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His colleagues nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are things to be talked over. We must decide
how much we can send, and that cannot be done upon the
spot. But there is a matter that can be settled at once.
Conon must be told that he is going to be relieved. Now,
who will tell him? Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you see fit to give me the order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would consult with Hippocles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; cried the president. &ldquo;He is just the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to help us. You will go and see him, and then report to
me. Come to me to-night; it will not matter how late it is;
I shall be waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias saluted, and withdrew.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>HIPPOCLES THE ALIEN.</small></h2>


<p>Hippocles has been described as an alien. An &ldquo;alien,&rdquo;
then at Athens, as in the other Greek cities, was
a resident foreigner. He might be an enfranchised
slave, he might be a barbarian (as all persons not Greek
were described), or he might be a Greek of the purest descent,
but if he had not the rights of Athenian citizenship,
he was an &ldquo;alien.&rdquo; He could not hold any landed or
house property: he was obliged to appear in any law
suit in which he might be concerned in the person of
an Athenian citizen who was described as his &ldquo;patron,&rdquo;
and he was heavily taxed. A special impost that went
under the name of an &ldquo;alien-tax&rdquo; was only a slight matter,
some twelve drachmas<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> a year, but all the imposts were
made specially heavy for them. And though they had no
share in directing the policy of the State, they were required
to serve in its fleets and armies. This treatment
however, did not keep aliens from settling in Athens. On
the contrary they were to be found there in great numbers,
and as almost all the trade of the place was in their hands,
some of them were among its richest inhabitants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of which I am writing Hippocles had the
reputation, which we may say was by no means undeserved,
of being the richest resident in Athens. And
more than that, he was one of the most patriotic. He
loved the city as if it had been his native place, and did the
duty and more than the duty of a son to her. The special
contributions which as a wealthy man he was called upon
to make to the public service<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> were made with a princely
liberality. He even voluntarily undertook services which
were not required of him by law. Every year he had come
forward to furnish the crew and munitions of a ship-of-war,
a charge to which citizens only were properly liable. And
of the fleet of which such gloomy tidings had just reached
Athens, he had equipped no less than three.</p>

<p>Hippocles had a curious history. He was born in the
Greek colony of Poseidonia.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He was just entering on
manhood when his native city fell into the hands of its
Lucanian neighbors. The barbarians did not abuse their
victory. They did not treat the conquered city, as the
Greeks of Croton some ninety years before had treated
Sybaris, reducing it to an absolute ruin. On the contrary
they contented themselves with imposing a tribute, and
leaving a governor, with a garrison to support him, to see
that their new subjects did not forget their duty. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
presence of the foreigner was a grievous burden to the proud
Greeks. For ages afterwards their descendants were accustomed
to assemble once a year and to bewail their fate, as
the Sons of Jacob at the Vale of Weeping, the Gentile
domination over their city. The disaster broke the heart
of Hippocles&rsquo; father Cimon who was one of Pacidoninus&rsquo;
most distinguished citizens and had actually held the office
of Tagus or chief magistrate in the year of its fall. He survived
the event scarcely a year, recommending his son with
his last breath to leave the place for some city where he
could live in a way more worthy of a Greek. His son spent
the next two years in quietly realizing his property, nor did
he meet with any interference from the Lucanian masters
of the place. His house he had to sacrifice; to sell it might
have attracted too much notice; but everything else that he
had was converted into money. When this was safely invested
at Athens&mdash;Athens having been for various reasons
the city of his choice&mdash;he secretly departed. But he did not
depart alone. He took with him a companion, who, he declared,
more than made up to him for all that as a Poseidonian
citizen he had lost. Pontia, the daughter of the
Lucanian governor, was a girl of singular beauty. The
Lucanian, in common with the other Italian tribes, gave to
their women a liberty which was unknown in Greek households.
Under the circumstances of life in which he had
been brought up, Hippocles though a frequent visitor at
the governor&rsquo;s house, would never, except by the merest
accident, have seen the governor&rsquo;s daughter. As it was he
had many opportunities of making her acquaintance. Instead
of being shut up, after the Greek fashion in the women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>&rsquo;s
apartments, she shared the common life of the family. At
first the novelty of the situation almost shocked the young
man; before long it pleased him; it ended by conquering his
heart. The young Greek, who was leaving his native land
because it did not suit his pride of race to live under the rule
of a barbarian, did not submit without an effort. Again
and again he reproached himself with the monstrous inconsistency
of which he was guilty. &ldquo;Madman that I am,&rdquo; he
said to himself, &ldquo;I cannot endure to live with barbarians
for neighbors and yet I think of taking a barbarian to
wife.&rdquo; Again and again he resolved to break free from the
influence that was enthralling him. But love was too
strong for him. Nor indeed, were there wanting arguments
on the other side. &ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I am a
Greek no more; a Greek without a city is only not a barbarian
in name.&rdquo; This argument, of little weight, perhaps,
in itself, gained force from the loveliness and mental charms
of the young Pontia. She had long felt a distaste for the
rough, uncultured life into which she had been born. The
culture and refinement of her father&rsquo;s young Greek guest
charmed her. The sadness of his mien touched the
chord of pity in her heart, and admiration and pity together
soon grew into love.</p>

<p>Hippocles had just completed the settlement of his affairs,
and was ruefully contemplating the curious dilemma in
which he found himself&mdash;everything ready for his departure
from Poseidonia, but Poseidonia holding him from such departure
by ties which he could break only by breaking his
heart&mdash;when circumstances suggested a way of escape.</p>

<p>The governor was a widower, and had more than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
usual incapacity of busy men in middle life for discerning
the symptoms of love. It was accordingly, with a cheerful
unconsciousness of his guest&rsquo;s feelings that he said to him
one morning:&mdash;&ldquo;I have good news about my dear Pontia.
The girl is growing up, and should be settled in life, and I
have had a most eligible proposal for her. I have told you,
I think, that I am getting tired of this life, and want to
get back to my farm among the hills. So I have asked to
be relieved, and I hear from the Senate that they have
chosen a successor, Hostius of Vulsi, a cousin, I should say,
of my own, and a most respectable man. Hostius has come
to announce the fact in person, and at the same time to ask
for my daughter in marriage. A most eligible proposal, I
say. Perhaps he is a little old, about five years younger
than myself. But that&rsquo;s of no consequence. I mentioned
the matter to her. She did not say much, but, of course, a
girl must seem to hold back. I suggested that the marriage
should take place next week&mdash;for I should dearly like to be
at home in time for the barley harvest. That roused her.
Of course she said that she had no clothes. I don&rsquo;t know
about that&mdash;she always seems to me to look very nice&mdash;but
I should not like to annoy her, for she is a dear, good girl,
and I gave her another month. It&rsquo;s an excellent arrangement&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hippocles muttered a few words of assent; but long before
the month was out, he and his Pontia were on their
way to Athens.</p>

<p>The marriage and the settlement in Athens had taken
place twenty-one years before the time of which I am
writing. Two children had been born, a son and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
daughter. The son had fallen, not many months before, at
the battle of Notium<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the death of the mother, who
had been in feeble health, had soon followed. The daughter,
to whom her parents had given the name of Hermione, had
just completed her sixteenth year.</p>

<p>Hermione united in herself some of the happiest characteristics
of the two races from which she sprang. Her
father was a Greek of the Greeks. Poseidonia had been
founded by Dorian settlers from Sybaris, who could not
contrive to live on good terms with the Achaean Greeks
that had become the predominant element in that city; and
Hippocles, who claimed descent from the Messenian kings,
yielded to none in nobility of birth. A purer type of the
genuine Hellenes it would have been impossible to find.
Pontia brought from the Lucanian hills, among which she
had been reared, some of the best qualities, moral and
physical, of the Italian race. The simplicity, frugality, and
temperance which then and long after distinguished rural
Italy, were to be seen in her united with a singular
feminine charm not so often found among that somewhat
rude population; until the close air of the Piraeus,
ill-suited to a daughter of the hills, sapped her constitution,
she had had a frame magnificently healthy and strong.
To the daughter the climate which had shortened her mother&rsquo;s
days, happily did no harm. It was in fact her native air,
and she throve in it. She was still undeveloped, for she
had only just completed her sixteenth year; but she gave
promise of remarkable beauty, and indeed, the promise was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
already more than half fulfilled. When she had performed
the duty, sometimes imposed on the daughters of resident
aliens,&mdash;it might be called, rather, privilege conceded to
them&mdash;and walked in the great procession of the patron-goddess,
holding a sunshade over some high-born Athenian
maiden,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> all the spectators agreed that the prize of beauty
belonged to the stranger. Her stature reached the very utmost
height that the canons of beauty conceded to women;
so far she was more of an Athene than an Aphrodite. But
her face and her whole bearing were exquisitely feminine.
The sapphire-colored eyes, shaded by long drooping lashes,
the forehead, broad and low with the clustering ringlets of
light chestnut on either side, perfectly rounded cheeks,
firm, delicate mouth, showing a glimpse, but only a glimpse
of pearly teeth, and a faultlessly clear complexion, just
tinted with the brown caught from &AElig;g&aelig;an suns and winds&mdash;for
she was dearly fond of a cruise in her father&rsquo;s yacht&mdash;made
up together a remarkable combination of charms.</p>

<p>Callias had seen her but once before, and that was on a
melancholy occasion. He had been commissioned by the
general in command to break to her father the death
of her brother, killed as has been said, in the unlucky
conflict at Notium. He had behaved there with conspicuous
gallantry, having led the boarding party which captured
the only Lacedaemonian galley that the Athenians had
to set off against their own fifteen losses, and had fallen in the
moment of victory. It was not the first time that he had
shown distinguished valor, and it was for this reason, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
well as on account of the high reputation of his father, that
Alcibiades had sent Callias with a special message of condolence.
The blow, which could not be softened by any delicacy
in the telling, and for which the praises of the general
were but a slight consolation, broke Hippocles down completely.
It was then that Hermione showed the strength
of her character. Tenderly attached herself to her brother
she had come forward to support her broken-hearted father.
With a patient endurance that was beyond all praise, she
had battled with her own grief in the effort to help a
sorrow even more agonizing than her own, till for very
shame Hippocles had raised himself to bear his loss with
resignation. The effort saved his life; for even the physicians
had at one time been greatly alarmed. Callias, accustomed
to think of women as encumbrances rather than
helps in time of need was profoundly impressed by the
girl&rsquo;s demeanor. If he had been inclined, for a moment,
to think that her singular self-possession indicated a want
of womanly feeling, he would have been soon undeceived.
Paying a visit of inquiry to the house next day, he found
that Hermione&rsquo;s endurance had not lasted beyond the occasion
for which it was wanted. Her father received him,
and told him that his daughter had broken down under the
strain. &ldquo;I was cowardly enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yesterday to
rest upon her strength when I should have summoned up
my own. The gods grant that I may not have taxed it
overmuch, and that I may not lose both my children. I
have learned that I ought not to have grudged my son to the
city which has been a second mother to me; if only I have
not learnt it at too terrible a price.&rdquo; Callias had to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Athens on the next day to rejoin the fleet, but he had the
satisfaction of hearing before his departure that Hermione
was on a fair way to recovery. Since then he had not been
in Athens.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>A COUNCIL.</small></h2>


<p>The house of Hippocles was on a smaller scale than might
have seemed suitable to his vast wealth. The fact was that
both he and his daughter had simple tastes. They had a
special dislike to the enormous establishments of slaves
which it was the fashion for rich Athenians, whether of
native or of foreign birth, to maintain. In each division
of the house&mdash;for, it was divided after the usual Greek
fashion, into two &ldquo;apartments,&rdquo; to use that word in its
proper sense, belonging respectively to the men and the
women<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;there were but three or four inmates besides
the master and mistress. Hippocles had his house steward
and his personal attendant, both older than himself, long
since emancipated, who had accompanied him from
his Italian home, and a lad of seventeen, who
was still a slave, but who, if he conducted himself
well, would certainly earn his freedom by the time that
he had reached the age of thirty. Hermione&rsquo;s establishment,
on the other hand, consisted of a lady who had just
exchanged the post of governess, now no longer necessary,
for that of companion or duenna, a housekeeper, and two
domestics who may be described by the modern terms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
lady&rsquo;s-maid and house-maid. Stephanion, the companion,
was of pure Athenian descent. She belonged to one of the
many families which had been reduced to poverty by the
war, and she had been glad to take employment in the house
of the wealthy alien. She had more education than was
commonly given to Athenian ladies, but this is not to say
much, and Hermione would have fared but ill for teaching,
according at least to our standard if her father had not always
found time even in his busiest days, to supplement
her education. The housekeeper was a Laconian woman.
She, too, had found her way into the family through circumstances
connected with the war. She had been nurse in a
wealthy Athenian household. Before the war it had been the
fashion, my readers should know, for the upper classes at
Athens to get their nurses from Sparta. A true Spartan, a
daughter that is, of the military aristocracy that ruled
Laconia and its dependencies, it was, of course, impossible
to obtain, but girls from the farmer class that cultivated the
lands of their soldier masters often sought situations in
other countries. This was the case with Milanion,
who as the youngest of the five daughters of a Laconian
farmer, had been delighted to find a place with an Athenian
lady, Melissa, wife of Demochares, at a salary which almost
equalled her father&rsquo;s income. This was just before the commencement
of the long war. She had been nurse to Melissa&rsquo;s
five children when the disastrous expedition to Sicily
brought irretrievable ruin upon her employer&rsquo;s family. Demochares
was one of the army that surrendered with Nicias,
was thrown with his comrades into that most dreadful of
prisons, the stone-quarries of Syracuse, and died of a fever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
before the end of the year. His property had consisted, for
the most part, of farms in the island of Chios, and when
Chios revolted from Athens, the widow and her children
were reduced to something very like poverty. Nothing was
left to them but a small farm at Marathon, and as it so
happened, the rent of the house which Hippocles unable,
as has been said, to own real property in Attica, had been
accustomed to hire. The establishment had to be broken
up, the slaves being sold and the free persons looking for
employment elsewhere. Milanion was about to return,
much against her will, to Laconia, where her long residence
at Athens would have rendered her an object of suspicion
and dislike, when an opening suddenly presented itself in
the family of Hippocles. Pontia&rsquo;s long illness had come to
a fatal end, and the widower was looking for an experienced
woman to take charge of the young Hermione. Milanion
seemed to him exactly the person that he wanted, and she,
on the other hand, was delighted to come to him. As her
charge grew older, her duties as nurse gradually changed
into the duties of a housekeeper. She had come to her new
situation accompanied by a middle-aged woman, a Marian
by birth, Manto by name, whom Hippocles had bought, at
her suggestion, at the sale of Demochares&rsquo; slaves. Manto
had steadily refused the emancipation which her master had
several times offered to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I thank you very much, but I am
better as I am. I desire nothing more than to live in your
house, and, when my time comes, to die in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if I should die first,&rdquo; suggested the merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gods know, my master, the gods know,&rdquo; cried the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
poor woman in an agony. &ldquo;But it is impossible; the gods
would not do anything so cruel, so unjust. But, if
you wish, you may put what you please into your will. As
long as you live you are my master, and I am your slave.&rdquo;
So matters stood when my story opens. Perhaps it may be
added that Manto&rsquo;s condition did not prevent her tongue
from being truthful; but affectionate, faithful, and honest,
she allowed herself and was allowed&mdash;no unusual circumstance,
yet she was under a system of slavery&mdash;a liberty of
speech which in one free born would certainly have been impossible.
Finally, to complete my account of the household,
Hermione had for her maid a girl about a year older than
herself. She too had come into the family along with
Milanion and Manto. Demochares had bought her at the
sale of the prisoners taken by the Athenians when a little
Sicilian town was captured. She was then a singularly
pretty child about seven years old, and Demochares
had meant her to be a playfellow or plaything, as
the case might be, of a daughter of his own of about the
same age. She was of mixed race; her mother was a
Sicanian, that is, one of the so-called aboriginal inhabitants
of Sicily, her father a Carthaginian trader. She was now
grown up into a handsome maiden, who with her raven-black
hair, dark piercing eyes, and deep brunette complexion,
made a remarkable contrast to the fair beauty of her
mistress.</p>

<p>When Callias reached the house the hour was late, later
than etiquette allowed for a visit, except from an intimate
friend, or on a matter of urgent business. His business,
however, was urgent, and he did not hesitate to knock, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
is to strike the door sharply with a brass ring which was
attached to it by a staple. The day-porter had gone home
for the night, and the door was opened by the young slave
mentioned above. He explained that his master was just
about to sit down to his evening meal. &ldquo;Take him my
name,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;and say that I come from the magistrates
on an important matter of business.&rdquo; The lad invited
him to enter, and to take a seat in a small chamber which
looked upon the central court of the andronitis, a grass plot,
bordered on all sides by myrtle and orange. In a few minutes
he returned, and invited the visitor to follow him.
Callias crossed the court and passed through the door which
led into the women&rsquo;s apartment. Hippocles, it should be
said, was accustomed to see visitors on business in the front
or men&rsquo;s portion of the dwelling, but spent his leisure time
in the rooms assigned to his daughter. The two had just
taken their places at the table, Hippocles reclining on a
couch, Hermione sitting on a chair by his right hand, so
that his face was turned towards her.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The steward had
placed the first dish on the table, and was standing in front,
with Hippocles&rsquo; personal attendant behind him. The latter
at a sign from his master, prepared a place for the new-comer.</p>

<p>Hippocles saluted his guest in a most friendly fashion,
and Hermione gave him her hand with a charming smile,
though the moment afterwards tears gathered in her eyes,
when she remembered the last occasion on which they had
met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the business will wait for half-an-hour,&rdquo; said the
host, &ldquo;postpone it for so long. I have had a long day&rsquo;s
work, and shall be scarcely myself till I have eaten. And
you&mdash;doubtless you have dined before this; but you will
take a cup with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Callias had not dined, though in the
excitement of the day&rsquo;s business he had almost forgotten
food. A hasty meal snatched on board the trireme which
had brought him to Athens had been his only refreshment
since the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, but I have not dined; unless you call some
five or six dried anchovies and a hunk of barley bread,
washed down with some very sharp Hymettus, a dinner;
and that was rather before noon than after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meal was simple. It consisted of some fresh anchovies,
a piece of roast pork, a hare brought from Eub&#339;a, for Attica
swept as it had been again and again by hostile armies, had
almost ceased to supply this favorite food, and a pudding of
wheat flour, seasoned with spices. This last had been made
by Hermione herself. The rest of the dinner had been
cooked by a man who came in daily for the purpose.
When the viands had been cleared away, Hippocles
proposed the usual toast, &ldquo;To our Good Fortune,&rdquo; the
toast not being drank, but honored by pouring some
drops from the goblet. A second libation followed, this
time to &ldquo;Athene the Keeper of the City.&rdquo; The host then
pledged his guest in a cup of Chian wine. His daughter
followed the rule of the best Grecian families, and drank
no wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can dispense, I think, with these,&rdquo; he said, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the steward was about to put some apples, nuts and olives
on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied his guest, &ldquo;and this excellent cup of
Chian will be all the wine that I shall want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then for business,&rdquo; said Hippocles. &ldquo;Let us hope
that the city will pardon us for postponing it so long.
But we must eat. Shall my daughter leave us? For my
part, I find her a very Athene for counsel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will, sir,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;I have nothing to
say but what all may know, and indeed will know before a
day is past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man then proceeded to tell the story with
which my readers are already acquainted. The question
was briefly this: How was Conon to be told that relief was
coming?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Hippocles, &ldquo;that he must be told. He is a
brave fellow, and a good general, too, though perhaps a
little rash. But he must make terms for himself and his
men, unless he has a project of relief. He would not be
doing his duty to the state if he did not. But if he capitulates
before the relief comes&mdash;how many ships has he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we can have a hundred, or possibly, a hundred and
ten here, by straining every nerve. The Spartans have a
hundred and forty, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few may have been disabled in the battle; but it would
not be safe to reckon on less, for very likely others have
been dropping in since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Conon&rsquo;s party will turn the scale, and they will
be better manned, I take it, than any that we shall be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to send out from here. They must not be lost to us. If they
are, we shall do better not to send out the fleet at all, but to
stand on our defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the <i>Skylark</i> in harbor now?&rdquo; asked Callias.</p>

<p>My readers must know that the <i>Skylark</i> was Hippocles&rsquo;
fast sailing yacht.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;she is in harbor and very much
at the service of the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me with her,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;and I will run the
blockade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is possible,&rdquo; answered Hippocles. &ldquo;I
gathered from what you said that the Spartans are inside
the harbor. Now you may give the slip to a blockading
squadron when it is watching a harbor from the outside.
They always keep close to the mouth you see; and a really
good craft, smartly handled, that can sail in the eye of the
wind, and does not draw much water, has always a good
chance. I&rsquo;ll warrant the <i>Skylark</i> to do it, if it is to be done.
But with the blockade <i>inside</i> the harbor, the case is different,
and I must own that I don&rsquo;t see my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I speak, father?&rdquo; said Hermione.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when have you begun to ask leave to use your
tongue, my darling?&rdquo; replied her father with a smile.
&ldquo;You should hear her lecturing me when we are alone,&rdquo; he
went on, turning to his guest. &ldquo;But our counsellor is not
used to speaking in an assembly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it be of any use,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;to disguise the
<i>Skylark</i>, by painting her another color and altering the cut
of her rigging?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good thought, my darling,&rdquo; replied her father, &ldquo;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
one that I shall certainly make use of. Now let me think;
just for the present, things do not seem to piece themselves
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose from the couch on which he had been reclining,
and paced up and down the room in profound thought.
Fully half an hour had passed when he suddenly stopped
short in his walk, and turned to his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see that you are getting
sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleepy, father?&rdquo; cried the girl, who indeed was as wide
awake as possible, &ldquo;sleepy? what can you mean? how could
I possibly feel sleepy, when we are talking about such
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless your father says it,&rdquo; replied Hippocles,
&ldquo;and fathers are never mistaken.&rdquo; And he laid his hand
upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>Without another word Hermione rose from her chair,
kissed her father, held out her hand again to Callias, and
left the room.</p>

<p>Hippocles waited for a few minutes, and then sat down
on the couch by Callias&rsquo; side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have guessed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I wanted the
girl away. I wish that I had never let her stay; now she
will suspect something; but it cannot be helped. Now,
listen. What the girl said about disguising the <i>Skylark</i> set
me thinking. That will be useful another time; indeed I
shall do it now. But it won&rsquo;t do all that we want. Disguised
or not disguised, I don&rsquo;t see how she is to get past
the Spartan ships in Mitylene harbor. Now we must try a
bolder play. I shall disguise myself, and go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, sir,&rdquo; cried Callias in astonishment. &ldquo;But think
of the danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Hippocles, &ldquo;we cannot expect to get anything
really valuable without danger. And I am something of
a fatalist. What will be will be. Now listen: I shall disguise myself
as a trader of Cos. I am a Dorian by birth, you know, and
I can use the broad vowels and the lisps to perfection I flatter
myself. I say Cos,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> because I happen to be particularly well acquainted
with its dialect. I shall go to Callicratidas<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and tell
him my story&mdash;what the story shall be I have not yet made up
my mind, but it is not hard to impose upon a Spartan. However
leave all that to me. Go and tell the magistrates that I undertake
to tell Conon that he will be relieved. And, mind&mdash;not
a word to my daughter. I shall tell her that I am called away
on important business. Very likely she will guess something
of the truth; but it would only trouble her to tell her more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the magistrates, sir?&rdquo; asked Callias, &ldquo;how much
are they to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, I think, than what I said, that Hippocles
the Alien undertakes to communicate with Conon. I
don&rsquo;t doubt the good faith and discretion of our friends; but the
fewer there are in the secret of such a plan, the better. Keep
a thing in your own mind, I say. If you whisper a secret even
unto the earth, when the reed grows up it will repeat it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
You will say simply that it is a matter which it is well
for the state to conceal. If I succeed, I justify myself;
if not&mdash;well, I take it, no man&rsquo;s anger here will concern
me much. And now farewell! Don&rsquo;t vex yourself about me.
All will turn out well; and if not&mdash;how can a man die better
than in saving Athens. All my affairs are arranged, if I
should not return. My patron Melesippus will, of course, be
my executor, and I have ventured to join your name with
his in the trust? Have I your permission?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias pressed his hand in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well, and now my mind is easy. And now,&rdquo; he
went on in a cheerful tone, &ldquo;farewell again; but before you
go, we must have a libation to Hermione who for the next
ten days must be my special patron. If I come back safe, I
will regild this temple from roof to basement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The libation was duly poured, and the vow repeated as
the drops fell upon the ground.</p>

<small>RUNNING THE BLOCKADE.</small></h2>


<p>Hippocles, who was a ship builder as well as a merchant,
put all available hands to work on the alterations which he
proposed to make in the <i>Skylark</i>. To disguise her effectually
was a more difficult thing than Hermione had imagined
when she had suggested this idea. To disguise her beyond
all risk of discovery was probably impossible, a landsman
might be deceived by different colored paint, and a
nautical observer, if he did not give more than a casual
glance, by an altered rigging. But the lines of the ship
would remain. These Hippocles endeavored to conceal by a
false and much broader bow which was ingeniously fitted
on to the true hull, and which made her look anything
but the fast sailer that she really was. Heavy bulwarks
were substituted for the light ones that had been a familiar
feature of the <i>Skylark</i>. Altogether she was metamorphosed
in a fairly satisfactory way from a smart yacht into a
clumsy merchantman. As the venturous owner intended
to time his arrival for the night, and to do his errand
before day-break, he hoped that the disguise would save
her as long as it should be wanted.</p>

<p>So much energy did the workmen, stimulated by their
master&rsquo;s presence and by his liberal promises of renumeration,
throw into their work, that by the evening of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
seventh day the <i>Skylark</i> was ready for sea in her new dress,
disguised beyond recognition, except by very skilful eyes
indeed. The dockyard had been strictly closed against all
visitors while the work was in progress, and the men had
been lodged within its walls, so that no hint of what was
going on might leak out. Hippocles had paid a daily visit
to his home, and did not conceal from his daughter that he
was busy in carrying out her suggestions. So frank, indeed,
was he, and so cheerful in manner, that the girl was fairly
thrown off her guard. Not a suspicion crossed her mind,
that her father was meditating a desperate enterprise in
which the chances were certainly rather against his life
than otherwise, nor did she realize the extraordinary haste
with which the work was being pressed on, though she was
generally aware that a good deal of expedition was being
used. Hence she was taken by surprise, when on the
eighth day instead of her father&rsquo;s usual visit, timed so that
he might share her noon-day meal, a written message was
delivered to her, to the effect that her father was suddenly
called away from Athens on business of importance, and
that he could not be certain of the day of his return. The
surprise almost overwhelmed her, chiefly because she
felt that this unusual hurry on the part of her father was
significant of the perilous nature of the enterprise. It was
only her unusual fortitude, backed by the feeling that she
herself must not deviate from doing her duty, that enabled
her to bear up at all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hippocles was on his way to the scene of
action. The <i>Skylark</i> crossed the &AElig;gean without meeting
with any misadventure. She was overhauled, indeed, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
about half her journey was accomplished by an Athenian
cruiser, and her owner had the satisfaction of finding that
so far his disguise was successful. The Athenian captain
was an acquaintance of his own (indeed there were few
prominent people in the city to whom he was not known)
and had actually been on board the <i>Skylark</i> more than
once; but he did not recognize either Hippocles or his vessel.
In fact he was about to carry her off as a prize when
Hippocles, still without discovering himself, produced
the pass with which he had been provided under the
seal of the Athenian authorities. His arrival at Mitylene
was happily timed in more ways than one. By a stroke of
that good fortune which is proverbially said to help the bold
it so happened that there was a violent north-east wind
blowing. This was a wind from which the harbor of
Mitylene afforded little or no shelter. In fact, when it was
blowing, most sailors preferred to be out on the open sea.
Hippocles accordingly found everything in commotion.
The blockading ships, which moored as they were across
the mouth of the harbor, felt the full force of the wind,
were anxious about their moorings, and had little attention
to give to any strange ship. The <i>Skylark</i> was in fact
hardly noticed in the darkness and confusion, and actually
got beyond the line of the blockading galleys, and as far as
the admiral&rsquo;s ship, without being challenged. For a few
moments he thought of boldly pushing on to the inner part
of the harbor, where, as has been said, the remainder of
the Athenian fleet was lying hauled up under the walls;
but when he was hailed by a voice from a Spartan ship,
one of two that lay almost directly in his way, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
abandoned the idea. &ldquo;Anaxilaus, merchant of Cos, to see
the admiral, on business of importance,&rdquo; was his reply
to the challenge. At the last moment he dropped his
anchor. A few minutes afterward, he came on board the
admiral&rsquo;s galley and reported himself to that officer.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to Callicratidas&mdash;for this was the
admiral&rsquo;s name&mdash;to describe him as a model Spartan. He
was rather a model Greek. The Spartans had great virtues
which however, it is curious to observe, seldom survived
transplantation from their native soil.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> They were frugal,
temperate, and just; but they were narrow in their habits of
thought and their conceptions of duty. A good soldier whose
efficiency was not diminished by any vice was their ideal
man. They could not enter into any large and liberal views
of life. And their views of statesmanship whether as regarded
their own city or the whole race in general were as
narrow as were their notions of private virtue. They sometimes
showed a great amount of diplomatic skill, a strange
contrast with the bluntness which was their traditional
characteristic, but of wide and general views they seem to
have been incapable. Yet Callicratidas seems to have been
an exception. We know comparatively little about him.
He emerges from absolute obscurity at the beginning of the
year with which my story opens, and it is only for a few
months that he plays a conspicuous part in history, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
from now up to the hour when we see him for the last
time, all his words and acts are marked with a rare nobility.</p>

<p>It was not difficult for Hippocles to invent a story which
should account for his presence at Mitylene. The domestic
politics of almost every Greek state were mixed up with the
great struggle that was going on between Athens and
Sparta. Everywhere the democratic party looked to Athens
as its champion, the aristocratic to Sparta. This was especially
true of the states which were called the allies but were
really the subjects or tributaries of Athens. A turn of the
political wheels that brought the aristocrats to the top
was commonly followed by a revolt from the sovereign
state; when, as was usually the case, they remained underneath,
they busied themselves in plotting for a change, and
their first step was to open communications with the Spartan
general or admiral in command.</p>

<p>In Cos the popular or pro-Athenian party was in the ascendant,
and their opponents were weak. The fact was
that the Spartans were not in good repute there. Six years
before their admiral Astyochus had plundered the island
laying hands impartially on the property of friends
and of foes. Still there was a party which remained faithful
to Sparta, and Hippocles preferred to speak as their representative.
His wide-spread connections as a merchant&mdash;and
Cos had a large trade with its famous vintages and
equally famous woven stuffs&mdash;gave him a knowledge of details
and persons that would have deceived a far more acute
and suspicious person than Callicratidas.</p>

<p>The merchant began the conversation by offering
the admiral a present of wine, and one of those almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
transparent robes of silk that were a specialty of the island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not be so churlish as to refuse what you have the
good will to offer me,&rdquo; said Callicratidas, &ldquo;but you must
understand that I do not accept these things for myself. I
accept no personal gifts; it is a dangerous practice, and has
given rise to much scandal. I shall send them to Sparta, and
the magistrates will dispose of them as they think fit. What
is this?&rdquo; he went on, taking up the robe and holding it
between his eyes and the lamp. &ldquo;What do you use it for?
for straining the wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hippocles explained that it was a material for garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Garments!&rdquo; exclaimed the Spartan, &ldquo;why, we might as
well wear a spider&rsquo;s web. It is not clothing at all. It
neither warms nor covers. Is it possible that there are
people so foolish as to spend their money on it? It is costly,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you ask me,&rdquo; replied Hippocles, &ldquo;I may say that it
costs about two minas a yard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two minas a yard!&rdquo; cried Callicratidas, whose Spartan
frugality was scandalized at such a price. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he added
after a short calculation, &ldquo;it is very nearly a seaman&rsquo;s pay
for a year,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> are there many who buy such costly stuff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dress of this material is the top of the fashion for ladies
in Athens and Corinth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the Spartan, &ldquo;do women wear such things?
It is incredible. I have always thought that things had
changed for the worse at home, but we have not got
as far as that. And now for your business.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Hippocles explained that there was a dissatisfied party in
Cos which was very anxious to get rid of Athenian rule. &ldquo;We
are not strong enough,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to do it of ourselves,
but send on a force and we will open the gates to you. Cos
is a strong place now, since the Athenians fortified it, and,
I should think, quite worth having.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if we put you in power,&rdquo; said the admiral, &ldquo;you
would begin, I suppose, by putting all your opponents to
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callicratidas was quite a different person from what Hippocles,
with his former experience of Spartans in command,
had expected to find. His disinterestedness, simplicity and
directness were embarrassing, and made him not a little
ashamed of the part that he was playing. He would have
dearly liked to speak out of his own heart to a man who
was transparently honest and well-meaning, but in his
position it was impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have, as you may suppose, sir,&rdquo; he said in answer to
this last suggestion, &ldquo;a great many injuries to avenge, but
we should not wish to do anything that does not meet
with your approval.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole thing does not meet with my approval,&rdquo; said
the Spartan, &ldquo;I hate these perpetual plots; I hate to see
every city divided against itself, and see the big persons in
Greece hounding them on to bloody deeds, and making our
own gain out of them. I wish to all the gods that I could
do something to bring this wretched war to an end. Why
should not Athens and Sparta be friends as they were in the
old days? Surely that would be better than our going on
flying at each others&rsquo; throats as we have been doing for now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
nearly twenty years past, while the Persian stands by, and
laughs to see us play his game. Where should we be&mdash;you
seem an honest man, by your face, though I cannot say
that I particularly like the errand on which you have come&mdash;where
should we be, I ask, if we had shown this accursed
folly twenty-odd years ago, when Xerxes brought up all
Asia against us? As it was we stood shoulder to shoulder,
and Greece was saved. And now we have to go cap in hand,
and beg of the very Persians who are only biding their time
to make slaves of us. I tell you, sir, I feel hot with shame
at the thought of what I have had myself to put up with in
this way. When I came here I found the pay-chest empty;
I don&rsquo;t want to complain of anybody, so I won&rsquo;t say how
this came about; but that was the fact, it was empty; the
men had had no wages for some time, and they would very
soon have had no food. I asked my officers for advice.
&lsquo;You must go to Cyrus,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;Cyrus is paymaster.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
It was a bitter draught to swallow, but I managed
to get it down. I went to his palace at Sardis. &lsquo;Tell your
master,&rsquo; I said to the slave who came to the door, a gorgeous
creature whose dress I am sure I could not afford to buy,
&lsquo;tell your master that Callicratidas, admiral of the Spartan
fleet, is here, and wishes to speak with him.&rsquo; The fellow
left me standing outside, and went to deliver his message.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>After I had waited till my patience was almost exhausted,
the man came back, and said &lsquo;Cyrus is not at leisure to see
you. He is drinking.&rsquo; Well, I put up with that. &lsquo;Very
good,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I will wait till he has done drinking.&rsquo; I
thought that I would go earlier the next day, though even
then it was scarcely an hour after noon. So I went at a
time when I thought that he could not possibly have taken
to his cups, and asked again to see him. This time they had
not the grace even to make an excuse. &lsquo;Cyrus is not at
leisure to see you,&rsquo; was the answer, and nothing more.
That was more than I could stand, and I went away. I
vowed that day, and believe me it was not only because I
had myself been insulted, that if I lived to go home, I
would do my very best to bring Sparta and Athens together
again. And now, sir, as to your business. I will send
home a report of what you say. If the authorities direct me
to take any action in the matter, I shall do my best to take
it with effect, but I tell you frankly that this idea does not
commend itself to me, and let me give you a bit of advice:
do your best to make peace in your city, as I shall do my
best to make peace in Greece. Depend upon it, that if we
don&rsquo;t, we shall have some one coming down upon us from
outside. It may be the Persian, though he does not seem
to me to have improved as a soldier; it may be the Macedonian,
who is a sturdy fellow, and helps us already to fight
our battles. Whoever it is he will find us helpless with an
endless quarrel and will make short work with us. And
now good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hippocles left the Spartan admiral full of admiration for his
manly and patriotic temper, and not at all pleased that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>had been obliged to play a false part with a man so transparently
honest.</p>

<p>About an hour after midnight the harbor was alarmed by
the cry that the ship from Cos had parted from her moorings.
Hippocles had taken advantage of a temporary increase
in the force of the wind to cut his cables, and to
drift toward the Athenian part of the harbor. Nobody was
able to answer the cry for help, even if it had not been
purposely raised too late. The <i>Skylark</i> had run the blockade,
and Conon knew that he was to be relieved.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>ARGINUS&AElig;.</small></h2>


<p>At Athens, meanwhile, the relieving fleet was being
fitted out with a feverish energy such as had never been
witnessed within the memory of man. Nine years before,
indeed, preparations on a larger scale, if cost and magnificence
are to be taken into account, had been made for the
disastrous expedition against Syracuse; but there was all the
difference in the world between the temper of the city at
the one time and at the other. Athens was at the height of
her strength and her wealth when she sent out her armament,
splendid, so to speak, with silver and gold, against
Syracuse. It was a mighty effort, but she did it, one may
almost say, out of the superfluity of her strength. Now she
was sadly reduced in population and in revenue; she was
struggling not for conquest but for life; she was making her
last effort, and spending on it her last talent, her last man.
To find a juster parallel it would have been necessary to go
back a life-time, to the day when the Athenians gave up
their homes and the temples of their gods to the Persian invaders,
falling back on their last defences, the &ldquo;wooden
walls&rdquo; of their ships. Many men had heard from father or
grandfather, it was just possible that one or two tottering
veterans may have seen with their own eyes, how on that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
day a band of youths, the very flower of the Athenian aristocracy,
headed by Cimon, the son of Miltiades, had marched
with a gay alacrity through the weeping multitude, to hang
up their bridles in the temple of Athene. For the time the
goddess needed not horsemen but seamen, and they gave
her the service that she asked for. Now the same sight was
seen again. Again the knights, the well-born and wealthy
citizens of Athens, dedicated their bridles to the patron
goddess, and went to serve as mariners on board the fleet.
Every ship that could float was hastily repaired and
equipped. Old hulks that had been lying in dock since the
palmy days when the veteran Phormion<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> led the fleet of
Athens to certain victory, were launched again and manned.
In this way the almost unprecedented number<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of one hundred
and ten triremes were got ready. To man these a general
levy of the population was made. Every one within
the age of service not actually disabled by sickness, was
taken to form the crews, and not a few who had passed the
limit volunteered. Even then the quota had to be made up
by slaves, who were promised their freedom in return for
their services. It was a stupendous effort, and one which
Athens made with her own strength. These were not mercenaries,
but her own sons whom she was sending out to
make their last struggle for life. Night and day the preparations
were carried on, and before a month was out from the
day on which the tidings of the disaster at Mitylene reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the city, the fleet was ready to sail. Its destination was
Samos, an island that had remained faithful to Athens
even after the disastrous end of the war in Sicily. Here it
was joined by a contingent of forty ships, made up of the
same squadron scattered about the &AElig;gean, the two triremes
of Diomedon<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> being among them. Diomedon was related
to Callias, and the young man asked and obtained leave
from the captain with whom he had sailed from Athens to
transfer himself to his ship.</p>

<p>A battle was imminent. The Spartan admiral had left
fifty ships to maintain the blockade of Mitylene, and sailed
to meet the relieving force. His numbers were inferior, but
pride, and perhaps policy, forbade him to decline the combat.
He had made a haughty boast to Conon, and he had
to make it good. &ldquo;The sea is Sparta&rsquo;s bride,&rdquo; he had said.
&ldquo;I will stop your insults to her.&rdquo; His fleet was now off
Cape Malta, the south-eastern promontory of Lesbos. The
Athenians had taken up their position at some little islands
between it and the mainland, the Arginus&aelig;, or White Cliffs,
as the name may be translated, a name destined to become
notable as the scene of the great city&rsquo;s last victory.</p>

<p>Callicratidas had watched the arrival of the Athenians,
and had concluded that, according to the usual custom of
Greek sailors, they would take their evening meal on shore.
Before long the fires lighted over all the group of islets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
showed that he was right. His own men had supped, and
they were ordered to embark in all haste and make an
attack which would probably be a surprise. What success
his bold and energetic action would have had we can only
guess. The stars in their courses fought against him. A
violent thunderstorm with heavy rain came on, and prevented
him from putting to sea.</p>

<p>The next day was fine and calm and the two fleets were
early afloat. Their arrangement and plan of action showed a
curious contrast, a contrast such as was almost enough to
make one of the great Athenian seamen of the past turn in
his grave. The Athenian ships were massed together; the
Spartans and their allies were formed in a single line.
Callias, who had never before been present at a great sea-fight,
but who had taken pains to acquire as much professional
knowledge as he could, expressed his surprise to
Diomedon. &ldquo;How is this, sir?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how can our ships
maneuver when they are packed together in this fashion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Diomedon, an old sailor who had been afloat for nearly
forty years, smiled somewhat bitterly as he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maneuver, my dear boy! That is exactly what we
want to avoid. We can&rsquo;t do it ourselves, and we don&rsquo;t
mean to let our enemies do it, if it can be helped. The generation
that could man&#339;uver is gone. Five and twenty
years of fighting have used it up. But, happily, we can still
fight, at least such a fleet as we have got to-day, the real
Athenian grit, can fight. If the weather holds fine, and I
think it will for the day, though I don&rsquo;t quite like the looks
of the sky, we shall do well, because we shall be able to
keep together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arrangement of the Athenian line may be very briefly
described. It had two strong wings, each consisting of sixty
ships, formed in four squadrons of fifteen. These wings
consisted wholly of Athenian galleys; the contingents of the
allies were posted in the centre, and were in single line,
either because they were better sailors, or because, as being
directly in front of the group of islets, they were protected
by their position.</p>

<p>The policy of the Athenian commander was successful.
Arginus&aelig; was not a battle of skillful maneuvers, but of
hard fighting. Such battles are often determined by the
fate of the general, and so it was that day. Callicratidas,
had that pride of valor which had often done such great
things for Sparta and for Greece, but which some times resulted
in immediate disaster. His sailing master, a man
of Megara, had advised him to decline a battle. A rapid
survey of the position, of the numbers of the enemy and of
the tactics which they were evidently intending to pursue,
had convinced this skillful, experienced seaman, that the
chances were against him. Callicratidas would not listen
to him. &ldquo;If I perish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Sparta will not be one
whit the worse off.&rdquo; It was the answer of a man who was
as modest as he was brave; but it was not to the point.
Sparta would be a great deal worse off if she lost not only
him&mdash;and he was worth considering&mdash;but, as actually happened,
nearly the half of her fleet.</p>

<p>The signal to advance was passed along the line, and the
admiral himself took up his place in the foremost ship.
The whole fleet could see him as he stood a conspicuous
figure in the lead. His stately and chivalrous presence, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
feeling that a man whom it was a privilege to follow anywhere,
gave, for a time, an effective encouragement. But
the loss was proportionately great when that presence was
removed. Early in the day his ship endeavored to ram
that which carried the Athenian admiral Diomedon, itself
in the van of the opposing force. Diomedon himself was at
the rudder and managed his galley with remarkable skill.
He avoided or rather half avoided the blow of the enemy&rsquo;s
boat, and this in such a way that the Spartan admiral lost
his balance, and fell into the water. Callias, who was standing
on the rear of the Athenian galley, at the head of a
detachment of men ready either to board or to repel boarders,
endeavored to save him; but the weight of his armor was
fatal. He sank almost instantaneously. His death, it is
easy to believe, cost Athens even more than it cost Sparta.
It would have been infinitely better for her to fall into his
hands than to have to sue for terms, as she did not many
months afterwards, to the less generous Lysander.</p>

<p>The battle lasted for several hours. About noon the
weather became threatening. The wind changed to the
south-west and the sea began to rise. By general consent
the struggle was suspended. Both sides had fought with
conspicuous valor, but there could be no doubt that the victory
remained with the Athenians. Their losses were serious,
nearly a fifth of their force, or to give the numbers exactly,
twenty-nine ships out of one hundred and fifty. But they
had inflicted much more damage than they had suffered.
Out of the small squadron of Spartan ships, ten in number,
nine had been destroyed; and more than sixty belonging to
the various allied contingents were either sunk or taken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
The fifty that remained&mdash;and there were barely fifty of
them&mdash;made the best of their way either to the friendly
island of Chios, or to Phoc&aelig;a on the mainland. Without
doubt the Athenians had won a great victory. Whether
the opportunity could have been used to restore permanently
the fortunes of the city, is doubtful; but it is certain that it
was lamentably wasted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>AFTER THE FIGHT.</small></h2>


<p>A council of war was held by the Athenian admirals on
one of the Arginus&aelig; islets as soon as they could meet after
the fighting had come to an end. Callias, by Diomedon&rsquo;s
desire, waited outside the tent in which the deliberations
were being held, and could not help hearing, so high were
the voices of the speakers raised, that there was an angry
argument about the course to be pursued. The intolerably
clumsy system of having ten generals of equal authority
was on its trial, if indeed any trial was needed, and was once
more found wanting.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Even if the right decision should be
reached, time was being wasted, time that, as we shall see,
was of a value absolutely incalculable.</p>

<p>When at last the council broke up&mdash;its deliberations had
lasted for more than an hour&mdash;and Diomedon rejoined the
young officer, he wore a gloomy and anxious look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that mischief will come of this.
I feel it so strongly that, though I ought not, perhaps, to
tell outside the council what has been going on within, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
must call you to witness. I did my very best to persuade my
colleagues. &lsquo;Our first business,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;is to save our friends.
There were twenty-six ships, I said, disabled. A few were
sunk on the spot; others, I am afraid, have gone down since;
but more than half, I hope, are still afloat. Even where the
ship is gone already, there are sure to be some of the crew
who have been able to keep themselves afloat either by
swimming or by holding on to floating stuff. For the sake
of the gods, gentlemen,&rsquo;&mdash;I give you my very words&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t
lose another moment. We have lost too many already.
Send every seaworthy ship that you have got to the rescue
of the shipwrecked. It is better to let ten enemies escape,
than lose a single friend.&rsquo; They would not listen to me.
They were bent, they said, on following up their victory,
an excellent thing, I allow; but only when the first duty of
making all that you have got quite safe has been performed.
One of them&mdash;I will mention no names&mdash;positively insulted
me. &lsquo;Diomedon,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;has doubtless had enough fighting
for the day.&rsquo; Why, in the name of Athene, do they put such
lowbred villains into office. The fellow has a long tongue,
and so the people elect him. I &lsquo;tired of fighting&rsquo; indeed? I
might have some excuse if I were, for I was hard at it, when
he was a thievish boy, picking up unconsidered trifles in the
market-place. Well; the end of it was that we came to a sort of
compromise. Forty-odd ships are to go and save what can be
saved from the wrecks&mdash;the gods only know how many will
be left by this time&mdash;while the rest are to make the best of their
way to Mitylene, and cut off the blockading squadron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, sir?&rdquo; asked Callias, &ldquo;with which squadron
are you to be?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to go to Mitylene, of course, after what that fellow
said, I could not ask to have the other duty; but I feel that
it is what I ought to be doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is to have it, sir,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, if you will believe it,&rdquo; answered the admiral,
with an angry stamp of the foot.  &ldquo;I mean no one of
ourselves, of the Ten. They are all so anxious to follow up
the victory, as they put it, and make a great show of taking
Spartan ships, that they will not take the trouble. Theramenes
and Thrasybulus are to do it. I know that they
have been in command in former years and may be supposed
to be competent. Thrasybulus, too, is trustworthy; but
Theramenes&mdash;to put it plainly&mdash;is a scoundrel. You know
that I don&rsquo;t care about politics; I am a plain sailor and
leave such things to others; but I say this, politics or no
politics, a man who turns against his friends is a scoundrel.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
I don&rsquo;t know what trick he is not capable of playing. Anyhow,
whether these two do the business ill or well, one of
the Ten ought to go. It would be better; and I am sure
trouble will come of our not going. Mind this is all in confidence.
You are never to breathe a word of it, till I give
you leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And am I to go with you, sir?&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;I forgot to tell you; the worry of
all this put it out of my mind. You are to take the despatch
to Athens.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the shipwrecked men&rdquo;&mdash;exclaimed Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must obey orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour afterward Callias was on his way to Athens; the
storm had now increased to something like a gale. As
the waves came from the south it was impossible to take a
straight course for the point in view, lying as it
did almost due west. Few ships in those days could
keep a straight line with the wind on the quarter.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Indeed it was soon impossible to keep up any
sail at all, nor was it safe, even if the strength of the rowers
already wearied by the labors of the day, had permitted it
to keep the ship broadside to the waves. Nothing remained
but to put her about and drive before the wind, a sail being
now hoisted again and the rowers exerting themselves to
the utmost to avoid being &ldquo;pooped&rdquo; by the heavy waves.
Toward morning the wind moderated, but by that time the
<i>Swallow</i>, for that was the name of the despatch-boat which
had been told off for the service, had been driven as much
as fifty miles out of her course. This would not have been of
much consequence, but that the timber of the <i>Swallow</i> had
been so strained by her battle with the sea that she began to
leak inconveniently, if not dangerously. Her crew, too,
were now in urgent need of rest. Under ordinary circumstances,
Chios, which could be seen, as the day broke, about
ten miles on the right bow, would have afforded a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>venient
shelter; but Chios was in the hands of the enemy.
The little island of Vara, lying some ten miles to the north-west,
was the only alternative. Here Callias, much against
his will, for he feared that his news would be anticipated,
was compelled to stop, the captains of the despatch-boat
refusing to proceed, until vessel and men were better able to
face the weather.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the delay did no harm. In fact it was
the means of his reaching Athens with more speed and
safety than he might otherwise have done. A day indeed
was lost in doing such repairs as the imperfect resources of
the little island permitted, but on the morrow, Callias
set out again, and was groaning over the day that
had been lost, and the very little good that the clumsy
boat-builders had been able to do for him, when he found
himself being rapidly overhauled by a vessel which had not
long before hove in sight. Before noon he recognized the
cut of the disguised <i>Skylark</i>, and at once ran up a signal
which Hippocles whom he supposed to be on board would,
he knew, recognize. The signal was immediately answered,
and before another half-hour had passed the <i>Skylark</i> was
along-side. After a brief colloquy it was arranged that the
<i>Swallow</i> should make the best of her way to Samos, where
there was an arsenal in which she could be properly repaired
and that Callias with his dispatches should take his passage
to Athens in the yacht.</p>

<p>Hippocles was acquainted with the general fact that the
Athenian fleet had won a great victory; but he knew no details,
and was eager to hear from the lips of one who had
taken a part in the action. And he had much that was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>teresting
to say to his young friend. The three weeks which
he had spent in Mitylene with the blockaded squadron had
not made him hopeful about the first issue of the war. He
had found that Conon was not hopeful, and Conon was as
able and intelligent an officer as Athens had in her service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This has been a stupendous effort on the part of the
city,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it has saved us for a time, but it can&rsquo;t
be kept, and it can&rsquo;t be repeated. Athens is like a gambler
reduced to his last stake. He wins it; very good. But then
he has to throw again; and as often as he throws, it is the
same&mdash;if he loses, he loses all. And, sooner or later, lose he
must. In the long run the chances are against us. We have
lost our <i>morale</i>. I saw a good deal of Conon&rsquo;s men when I
was shut up, and I thought very badly of them; and he
thinks badly, too, I know. It is only a question of time.
Do you know,&rdquo; he went on, sinking his voice to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;and
mark you, this is a thing that I should not venture
to say to anyone in the world but you&mdash;I am half inclined
to wish that we had been beaten in the last battle&mdash;that is, if
Callicratidas had lived. A noble fellow indeed! Do you
know that he let the Athenians whom he took at
Methymna go on their <i>parole</i>? Any one else would have
sold them for slaves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Callias, who was a little staggered by his
friend&rsquo;s view of affairs, &ldquo;as your hero is drowned&mdash;mind
that I quite agree in what you say of him&mdash;perhaps it is
better that things have turned out as they have. And I
can&rsquo;t believe that our chances are as bad as you make out.
Anyhow we are better off than when I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so; I hope so;&rdquo; said Hippocles in a despondent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
tone, &ldquo;But they might have done better. For instance,
we have let the blockading squadron at Mitylene escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked Callias. &ldquo;Did you see nothing
of our fleet. It was to sail northward at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I never saw or heard of it. Now listen to what happened.
On the day after the battle&mdash;though of course I knew
nothing of what happened&mdash;<i>two</i> despatch-boats came into the
harbor&mdash;so at least everyone thought&mdash;and the second had
wreaths on mast and stern, as if it had brought good news.
And Eteonicus&mdash;he was in command of the blockading squadron&mdash;was
good enough to send us a herald with the intelligence
that Callicratidas had won a great sea fight, and that the whole
of the Athenian fleet had been destroyed. Of course we did not
quite believe that, but if only a quarter of it was true, it was not
pleasant hearing. My old sailing master, who has as sharp
eyes as any man I know, said to me. &lsquo;My belief, sir, is that it is
all nonsense about this great victory, and that the second boat
was only the first <i>dressed up</i>. I observed them both particularly,
and they were amazingly alike. In both the bow
sides oars were just a little behind the stroke, and one of the
oars, I noticed, was a new one, and not painted like the rest.
And why should the man take the trouble to tell us about
the victory as he calls it. If it is true, he has us safe, and
can cut us up at his leisure. No, sir, I don&rsquo;t believe a word
of it.&rsquo; Well, I was not certain that the old man was right,
but I strongly suspected that he was. Anyhow I was so convinced
of it that I spent the whole night in getting ready;
and, sure enough, the next morning the blockading squadron
had slipped off, with nobody to hinder them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a very smart trick for a Spartan,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE NEWS AT ATHENS.</small></h2>


<p>The <i>Skylark</i> excelled herself in the display of her sailing
qualities. Thanks to this, Callias, in spite of the untoward
delays which had occurred on his journey, was the first to
bring intelligence of the victory to Athens. The news ran
like wild fire through the city, gathering, as may be supposed,
a vast number of imaginary details, as it passed from
mouth to mouth, and the assembly which was called by
proclamation for the next day, to hear the reading of the
despatches, was, considering the empty condition of the
city, most unusually crowded. No one who could crawl to
the market-place was absent, and all the entrances and approaches
were thronged by women, children, and slaves.
The first stress of fear had been relieved, for it was known
that a victory had been won; but there was still much room
for anxiety. The victory had not been gained without cost&mdash;no
victories ever were&mdash;and it was only too probable that
in this case the cost had been heavy. The despatch was
brief and formal. It told the numbers engaged, and the
order of formation, with the number of hostile vessels captured
or sunk. It mentioned the fact that there had been
losses on the side of the conquerors, and promised details
when there should have been time to ascertain the facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>After the assembly had been dismissed, Callias was overwhelmed
with enquiries. To these he thought it well to
return very vague answers. The fact was that there was
much that he knew and much that he did not know. He
knew the name of more than one of the ships that had been
sunk or disabled. Two or three had been run down before
his eyes. About others he had information almost equally
certain. He could have told some of his questioners what
would have confirmed their worst fears. On the other hand
he could not give anything like a complete list of the losses.
Some enquirers he could reassure. He had seen or even
talked to their friends after the battle. All the admirals, he
knew, were safe. And steps, he was sure, had been taken
to rescue the shipwrecked crews. On the subject of Diomedon&rsquo;s
fears he preserved absolute silence. If any disaster
had happened, it was only too sure to be heard of before
long.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day of assembly a great banquet
was held in the Prytaneum, or Town-hall of Athens. Such a
banquet was always an interesting sight, and on this occasion
Callias, as he witnessed it for the first time, also saw
it to the very greatest advantage. All the public guests<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
of the city that were not absent on active service or were not
positively hindered from coming by age or infirmity were
present. The ranks of these veterans were indeed sadly
thinned. The war had been curiously deadly to officers
high in command. The fatal expedition to Sicily had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
swept off many of the most distinguished. Others had
fallen in the &ldquo;little wars&rdquo; in which Athens like all states
that have wide dominions had been perpetually involved.
One famous survivor of a generation that had long since
passed away was there, Myronides, the victor of &#338;nophyta.
The old man had been born in the Marathon year, and was
therefore now eighty-four. His life, it will be seen, embraced
with remarkable exactitude the period of the greatness of
Athens. The victory that had made him famous had been
won fifty-one years before, and had been, so to speak, the
&ldquo;high water mark&rdquo; of Athenian dominion.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He had lived
to see almost its lowest ebb, though happily for himself as he
died before the year was out, he was spared from seeing the
absolute ruin of his country. Callias was distantly related
to him and was on terms of as close a friendship as the difference
of age permitted with his son Eteonicus, one of the
ablest and most patriotic statesmen of the time. After the
libation which was the usual signal for the wine drinking,
had been poured, the old man rose from his place, as his
habit was, and walked down the hall, touching our hero on
his shoulder as he passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, as Callias looked up, &ldquo;if you can spare half
an hour from the wine cup to bear an old man company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man immediately left his place and accompanied
the veteran to one of the small chambers leading
from the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now tell me all about it,&rdquo; he said, when they were
seated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Callias gave him as full an account as he could of all that
he had seen during the campaign. Myronides plied him
with questions that showed an intelligence of unabated vigor.
The armament and sailing qualities of the ships, the <i>morale</i>
and <i>physique</i> of the crews, every detail, in fact, that concerned
the efficiency of the force that Athens had in the
field, were subjects of liveliest interest to the old man.
When he had heard all that his young kinsman had to say,
he heaved a deep sigh. &ldquo;Ah! my dear boy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;things have come to a pretty pass with Athens. As
an old soldier I know what some of the things that you tell
me mean better than you do yourself. We are near the beginning
of the end, and I can only hope that I shall be gone
when the end itself comes. I don&rsquo;t mean that this is not a
great victory that Diomedon and the rest of them have won;
but it is a victory that will never be won again. In the
very nature of things it can not. Do you think that the
old men and boys that I won the day with at &#338;nophyta<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
would have sufficed for a regular force, a force that the city
could rely on? Of course not. I could not even have
afforded to risk the chance if they had not had something
strong behind them. But now what is there? Old men
and boys, and nothing behind them. The slaves, you say?
Very good; they fought very well, I hear. And of course
they will get their freedom. Do you think that they will
fight as well again after they have got it? Why should
they? A man may as well die as be a slave, and so they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
might very well risk their lives to get free. But, once free,
why should they risk them again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Callias, &ldquo;not to keep the Spartans out of
Athens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk as an Athenian,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and they
are not Athenians. You and I, I allow, would sooner die
than see Spartans within the walls: but what would it matter
to them? They could eat and drink, buy and sell just as
comfortably whoever might be their masters. Yes, my
son; it is all over with a city that has to fall back on its
slaves. There is only one chance, and that is to make peace
<i>now</i>, before we lose all that we have gained. But what
chance is there of that? Is there any one who would even
dare to propose such a thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would, sir,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I might; but to what profit? I don&rsquo;t suppose they
would do me any harm. &lsquo;Poor old man!&rsquo; they would say,
&lsquo;he dotes.&rsquo; But as for listening to me&mdash;I know better than
that. Is there one of the responsible statesmen who would
venture to give such advice? Would my son Eteonicus
venture? Not he; and yet he is a sensible and honest young
man, and knows that I am right. But it would be
as much as his life, or, what he values more, his whole
career is worth, to hint at such thing. Oh! what opportunities
I have seen lost in this way. Unfortunately a victory
makes the Athenians quite impracticable.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> They do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>n&rsquo;t
seem capable of realizing that the wheel is certain to take a
turn. But you have had enough of an old man&rsquo;s croakings.
The gods grant that these things may turn out better than
my fears! And now give me your arm to the gate, where
my people will be waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias conducted the old man to the door, and saw him
put safely into the litter which was waiting for him. He
then stood meditating how he should dispose of himself for
the rest of the evening. He was unwilling to return to the
banquet. Questions would be put to him, he knew, by
many of the guests to which it would be difficult either to
give or to refuse an answer. He would gladly, indeed, have
hidden himself altogether till the fuller despatches should
have arrived, which would relieve him of the necessity of
playing any longer the difficult part which had been imposed
upon him. His thoughts naturally turned to Hippocles
and Hermione, and he had already taken some steps
in the direction of the Peiraeus, when the thought occurred
to him that he was scarcely on terms of such intimacy with
the family as would warrant a visit at so late an hour. As
he stood irresolute, the door of a neighboring house opened,
and a party of four young men issued from it into the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried one of them, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis the sober Callias. Seize
him, Glaucus and Eudaemon, and make him come with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men addressed ran up to our hero, and laid hold
each of an arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a prisoner of my spear,&rdquo; said the first speaker,
whose name, I may say, was Ctesiphon, &ldquo;and may as well
submit to your fate with as much grace as possible. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
shall not suffer anything unendurable, and shall be released at
the proper time. Meanwhile you must join our expedition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I submit,&rdquo; said Callias, willing, perhaps, to have the
question that had been puzzling him settled for him. &ldquo;But
tell me, if I have to follow you, whither you are bound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to the house of Euctemon, where there
will be something, I know, worth seeing and hearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am a stranger,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stranger!&rdquo; cried Ctesiphon, &ldquo;you are no such thing.
The man who brings good news to Athens is the friend of
everybody. Besides Euctemon is my first cousin, and he
is always pleased to see my friends. You should have been
at his dinner, but that there was no room on his couches
for more guests. But now when the tables are removed<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
we shall easily find places. But come along or we shall
lose something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no want of heartiness in Euctemon&rsquo;s greeting
to his new guests. To Callias he was especially polite, making
room for him on his own couch. When the new arrivals
were settled in their places, the host clapped his hands. A
white-haired freedman, who acted as major-domo, appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are ready for Stephanos,&rdquo; said Euctemon.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards a figure appeared, so curiously
like the traditional representations of Homer that every one
was startled. Stephanos was a rhapsodist, or professional
writer, and he had made it one of the aims of his life to imitate
as closely as he could the most distinguished member
that his profession could boast. In early life he had been a
school master, and an accident, if we may so describe a blow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
from the staff of a haughty young aristocrat, whom he
had ventured to chastise, had deprived him of sight. His
professional education had included the knowledge of the
authors whom the Greeks looked upon as classics, Homer
holding the first place among them, and he was glad to
turn this knowledge to account, when he was no longer
able to teach. In this occupation too his blindness could be
utilized. It had its usual effect of strengthening the memory,
and it helped him to look the part, which, as has been
said, he aspired to play.</p>

<p>The blind minstrel was guided to the seat which had been
reserved for him in the middle of the company by an attendant,
who also carried his harp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we have, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked the host.
&ldquo;You will hardly find anything worth learning that
Stephanos does not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guests had various tastes, so various that it seemed
very difficult to make a choice. One wanted the story of
the Cyclops, another the tale as told by Demodocus to
Alcinous and the Ph&aelig;acian princes, of the loves of Ares and
Aphrodite. A third, of a more sober turn of mind, called for one
of the didactic poems of Solon, and a fourth would have one
of the martial elegies with which the old Athenian bard Tyrtaeus
stirred, as was said, the spirits of the Spartan warriors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Callias, the bringer of good news, name it,&rdquo; said
Euctemon, after some dozen suggestions had been made.</p>

<p>The proposal was received with a murmur of approval.</p>

<p>The young man thought for a moment. Then a happy
idea struck him. About a year before there had occurred
an incident which had roused the deepest feeling in Athens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
The aged Sophocles, accused by his son Iophon before a
court of his clansmen, of imbecility and incapacity for managing
his affairs, had recited as a sufficient vindication of
his powers, a noble chorus from a play which he was then
composing, the last and ripest fruit of his genius&mdash;the
&ldquo;&#338;dipus in Colonus.&rdquo; The verses had had a singular success,
as indeed they deserved to have, in catching the popular
fancy. They were exquisitely beautiful, and they were
full of patriotic pride. Every one had them on his lips; and
before they had time to grow hackneyed, the interest in
them had been revived by the death of the veteran poet
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us have the &lsquo;Praises of Athens&rsquo; by Sophocles the
son of Sophilus of Colonus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The choice met with a shout of applause. The minstrel
played a brief prelude on his harp in the Dorian or martial
mood,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and then began:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Swell the song of praise again;<br />
Other boons demand my strain,<br />
Other blessings we inherit,<br />
Granted by the mighty spirit;<br />
On the sea and on the shore,<br />
Ours the bridle and the oar.<br />
Son of Chronos old whose sway<br />
Stormy winds and waves obey,<br />
Thine be heaven&rsquo;s well-earned meed,<br />
Tamer of the champing steed;<br />
First he wore on Attic plain<br />
Bit of steel and curbing rein.<br />
Oft too, o&rsquo;er the water blue,<br />
Athens strains thy laboring crew;<br />
Practiced hands the barks are plying,<br />
Oars are bending, spray is flying,<br />
Sunny waves beneath them glancing.<br />
Sportive myriads round them dancing,<br />
With their hundred feet in motion,<br />
Twinkling &rsquo;mid the foam of ocean.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>He concluded amidst thunders of applause, the reference
to the fleet being especially rewarded with a purse from the
host and a shower of gold pieces from the guests.</p>

<p>Other recitations followed, not all, it must be confessed, in
so elevated a strain; each was produced with a few bars of
music appropriate to its character.</p>

<p>The next entertainment was of a less intellectual kind.
Now dancers were introduced into the room by the trainer who
had taught them, and whose slaves in fact they were. The
man was a red-faced, bloated looking creature, who, however,
had been very active in his time, and could still display
a wonderful amount of agility when he was engaged
in teaching his pupils. The dancers were brother and
sister, twins, and curiously alike, though the boy was nearly
a half-head taller, and generally on a larger scale than the
girl. The performance commenced with a duet of the harps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and the flute. The harp, a small instrument not larger than
a violin was played by the boy, the flute by a female player,
who had come into the room along with the dancers. After a
while the harp became silent, the flute continuing to give
out a very marked measure. To this the girl began to dance,
whirling hoops into the air as she moved, and catching them
as they fell. Many were in the air at once, and the girl
neither made a single step out of time nor let a single hoop
fall to the ground.</p>

<p>A more difficult and exciting performance followed. The
flute-player changed the character of her music. The Lydian
measure which had been admirably suited to the graceful steps
of the dance gave place to the swift Phrygian scale, wild and
fantastic music such as might move the devotees of Cybele
or Dionysus to the mysterious duties of their worship. At
the same time an attendant of the trainer brought in a
large hoop, studded round its inner circle with pointed
blades. The girl commenced to dance again with steps that
grew quicker and quicker with the music, till, as it reached
a climax of sound, she leapt through the hoop. The flute-player
paused for a moment, as the dancer turned to recover
her breath, her bosom rising and falling rapidly, and her
eyes flashing with excitement. Then the music and the
dance began again, with the same <i>crescendo</i> of sound and
motion, till the same culminating point was reached, and
the same perilous leap repeated.</p>

<p>The spectators watched the scene with breathless interest;
but it was an exhibition that was scarcely suited to Greek
taste. A Greek could be even horribly cruel on occasions,
but a cruel spectacle&mdash;and spectacles that depend for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
attraction on the danger to the performer are critically
cruel&mdash;offended their artistic taste. The company began to
feel a little uneasy, and Euctemon finally interrupted the
festival when after the second leap had been sucessfully
accomplished he signed to the flute-player to cease her
music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; he said to the dancer, &ldquo;Aphrodite and the
graces would never forgive me, if you were to come to any
harm in my house. It is enough; you have shown us that
no one could be more skilful or more graceful than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy and girl now performed together in what was
called the Pyrrhic or war dance. Each carried a light
shield and spear, made of silvered tin. They represented
two warriors engaged in single combat. Each took in turn
the part of the assailant and the assailed, the one darting
forward the spear which had been carefully made incapable
of doing any harm, the other either receiving the blow upon
his shield or avoiding it with agile movements of the body.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The flute-player accompanied the dance with a very lovely
and spirited tune, while the company looked on with the
greatest admiration, so agile, so dexterous, and so invariably
graceful were the motions of the two dancers.</p>

<p>When the boy and girl had retired, and while the guests
were again devoting themselves to the wine, Callias was accosted
by a neighbor with whose handsome features, characterized
as they were by a gravity not often seen in young
Athenians, he was familiar, though he did not happen ever
to have made his acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am about to retire,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;and if I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
presume so far, I would recommend you to do the same.
Our host is hospitable and generous, and has other virtues
which I need not enumerate; but his entertainments are apt
to become after a certain hour in the night such as no
modest young man&mdash;and such from your face I judge you to
be&mdash;would willingly be present at. So far we have had an
excellent and blameless entertainment; but why not depart.
What say you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am ready to go with you,&rdquo; answered Callias.
&ldquo;My friend Ctesiphon brought me hither, and I know
nothing of our host except the report of his riches and
liberality.&rdquo; &ldquo;What! are you going?&rdquo; cried the host, as the
two young men rose from their places. &ldquo;Nay, but you are
losing the best part of the entertainment. It is but
a short time to the first watch when Lyricles will come
with his troop of dancers. He says that they are quite incomparable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; said the young man who had spoken to
Callias, &ldquo;you must excuse us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried one of the guests, a young dandy, whose
flushed face and flower-garland set awry on his forehead
seemed to show that he had been indulging too
freely in his host&rsquo;s strong Chian wine, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis old Silverside.
He pretends to be a young man; but I believe that he is
really older than my father. At least I know that the old
gentleman is far more lively. Come, Philip and Hermogenes,&rdquo;
he went on addressing two of his neighbors, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
let us permit our pleasant party to be broken up in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three revellers started up from their places, and were
ready to stop the departing guests by force. But the host,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
who was still sober, and was too much of a gentleman to
allow annoyances of the kind to be inflicted upon anyone in
his house, interfered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, gentlemen,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I will put force on no man
for if our friends think that they can be better or more
pleasantly employed elsewhere, I can only wish them good
night, and thank them for so much of their company as
they have been pleased to bestow upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two, accordingly, made their escape without any
further interference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you walk with me as far as my house,&rdquo; said Callias&rsquo;
companion to him. &ldquo;It lies in the Agr&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The night is
fine and I shall be glad of your company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias cheerfully consented, and was glad that he had
done so, so witty and varied was his companions conversation.</p>

<p>When they had reached their destination his new friend
invited him to enter. This he declined to do for the hour
was late, and he wished to be at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we can at least meet again.
This, you see, is my house, and my name is Xenophon, the
son of Gryllus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>SOCRATES.</small></h2>


<p>Callias lost no time in cultivating the acquaintance of
his new friend. The very next day he called upon him at
as early an hour as etiquette permitted, and was lucky
enough to find him at home. He had lately returned, indeed,
from drilling with the troop of Knights to which he
belonged, and was just finishing his breakfast, which had
been delayed till his military duties had been performed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you drink a cup to our new friendship&mdash;if you will
allow me to call it so?&rdquo; said Xenophon, to the young man
as he entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;if I decline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Xenophon, &ldquo;this is one of the offers
which formality commands us to make&mdash;whether rightly or
wrongly, I cannot say&mdash;but which I always myself refuse,
and am glad to see refused by others. But what will you?
A game of koltabos, or a walk to the springs of the
Ilissus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;would be agreeable, but first now
I have set my heart on something else. You are a disciple of
Socrates, I am told. Can you manage that I may have the
privilege of hearing him? I have never had the chance of
doing so before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xenophon&rsquo;s face brightened with pleasure when he heard
the request. &ldquo;Excellent, my dear sir, you could not have
suggested anything that would have pleased me better. We
shall certainly be good friends. I always judge a man by
what he thinks of Socrates. You are ready, I know, to admire
and love him, and I offer you my friendship in advance.
Now let us go and find him. It will not be difficult,
for I know his ways pretty well. There is a sacrifice in the
Temple of Theseus, and he will probably be there. There is
no more diligent attendant at such functions, and yet the
fools and knaves say that he is an atheist. We shall catch
him just as he is leaving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The subject of conversation between the two young men
as they walked along was naturally the character of this
philosopher whom they were about to see. Callias had
much to ask, and Xenophon had still more to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are going to see this man for the first time,&rdquo;
said the latter, &ldquo;you will be interested in hearing how I first
came to make his acquaintance. It was about nine years
ago, very soon, I remember, after the first expedition sailed
for Syracuse. I had been hearing a course of lectures by
Prodicus of Ceos, who was then all the fashion in Athens, and
was hurrying home to be in time for the midday meal.
Socrates met us in a narrow alley, and put his staff across it to
bar the way. What a strange figure he was, I thought. I had
never seen him before, you must know; for we had been
living for some years on my father&rsquo;s estate in Eub&#339;a.
Certainly he looked more like a Silenus than an Apollo.
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; my son, he said, looking at me with a smile that
made him look quite beautiful, &lsquo;can you tell me where a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
good tunic is to be bought?&rsquo; I thought it was an odd
question, though certainly he might want a tunic for himself,
for his own was exceedingly shabby. However I answered
it to the best of my ability. &lsquo;And a good sword&mdash;where
may that be purchased?&rsquo; That I told him also as
well as I could. Some half-dozen more things he asked me
about, and I did my best to reply. At last he said, &lsquo;Tell me
then, my son, since you know so well where so many good
things are to be procured, tell me where the true gentleman<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
is to be found?&rsquo; That puzzled me exceedingly, and I could
only lift my eyebrows and shrug my shoulders. How could
I answer such a question? Then he said, &lsquo;follow me my
son, and be taught.&rsquo; I never went near Prodicus again, you
may be sure. My father was somewhat vexed, for he had
paid a quarter of a talent as fee for the course of lectures.
However it did not cost him anything, for Socrates will
never take a fee. From that day to this I have never
missed an opportunity when I was not campaigning of hearing
him. But see there he is!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">THE TEMPLE OF THESEUS.</span>
</div>

<p>Socrates was standing in the open space in front of the
Temple of Poseidon, with the customary group of listeners
round him. As the two young men came up the discussion
which had been going on came to an end, and the philosopher
turned to greet the new comers. &ldquo;Hail! Xenophon,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;and you, too, sir, for the friends of Xenophon are
always welcome.&rdquo; &ldquo;You, sir,&rdquo; he went on addressing Callias,
&ldquo;are recently back from the war; now tell me this.&rdquo;
And he asked questions which showed that military de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>tails
were perfectly well known to him, better known to
him in fact than they were to Callias himself. These questions
were becoming a little perplexing, for Socrates had an
inveterate habit of driving into a corner, it may be said,
every one with whom he conversed. Luckily for Callias,
another friend came up at the moment, and the great examiner&rsquo;s
attention was diverted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Aristarchus,&rdquo; he cried to the new comer, &ldquo;how
fare you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But poorly, Socrates,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Things are
going very ill with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And indeed,&rdquo; said the philosopher, &ldquo;I thought that you
had a somewhat gloomy look. But tell me&mdash;what is your
trouble? Xenophon here is your kinsman, I know, and
you will not mind speaking before him, and he will answer
for the discretion of his friend. Or would you prefer that
we should go apart and talk, for to that too, I doubt not,
these two gentlemen will consent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the man who had been addressed as Aristarchus,
&ldquo;I am not ashamed or unwilling to speak before
Xenophon and his friend Callias, in whom I have the
pleasure of recognizing a kinsman of my own. For that
from which I am suffering, though it troubles me, has
nothing shameful in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak on then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;and, perhaps, among us
we shall be able to find some remedy for your trouble. For surely
it is of some use to share a burden if it be too heavy for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen then, Socrates,&rdquo; said Aristarchus, &ldquo;I have
been compelled for kindred&rsquo;s sake to take into my
home not a few ladies, sisters, and nieces, and cousins,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
whose husbands or fathers, or other lawful protectors, have
either perished in the war, or have been banished. There
are fourteen of them in all. Now, as you know, nothing comes
in from my country estate, for who will farm that which at
any time the enemy may ravage? And from my houses in
the city there comes but very little, for how few are they
who are able to pay rent? And no business is being done
in the city, nor can I borrow any money. Verily there is
more chance of finding money in the street, than of borrowing.
O, Socrates, &rsquo;tis a grievous thing to see my own flesh
and blood perish of hunger, and yet, when things are as
they are, I cannot find food for so many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis grievous indeed,&rdquo; said Socrates. &ldquo;But tell me&mdash;how
comes it to pass that Keramon feeds many persons in his
name, and yet can not only provide what is needful for himself
and his inmates, but has so much over that he
grows rich while you are afraid of perishing of hunger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Socrates, why ask such a question? The many
persons whom he so keeps are slaves, while the inmates of
my house are free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which then, think you, are the worthier, your free persons,
or Keramon&rsquo;s slaves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless my free persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, surely, it is a shame, that he having the less worthy
should prosper, and you with the more worthy, be in
poverty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless &rsquo;tis because his folk are artisans while mine
have been liberally educated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By artisans you mean such as know how to make useful
things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barley meal is a useful thing, for instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And bread?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s cloaks, and short frocks, and
mantles, and vests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your folk don&rsquo;t know how to make any of these
things. Is it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, but they know how to make them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not know then, how Nausicydes not only supports
himself and his household by making barley meal,
and has become so rich that he is often called upon to make
special contributions to the State<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and how Cor&#339;lus, the
baker, lives in fine style on the profits of bread-making, and
Demias on mantle-making, and Menon on cloak-making,
and nearly every one in Megara on the making of vests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very true, Socrates. But all these buy barbarians
for slaves, and make them work; but my people are free by
birth and kinsfolk of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And because they are free and kinsfolk of yours must
they do nothing but eat and sleep? Do you suppose that
other free people are happier when they live in this indolent
fashion, or when they employ themselves in useful occupations?
What about your kinsfolk, my friend? At present
I take it, you do not love them, and they do not love you,
for you think them a great trouble and loss to you, and they
see that you feel them to be a burden. It is only too likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
that all natural affection will turn under these circumstances
to positive dislike. But if you will put them in the way
of making their own livelihood, every thing will go right;
you will have a kindly feeling for them because they will be
helping you, and they will have as much regard for you,
because they will see that you are pleased with them. They
know, you say, how to do the things that are a woman&rsquo;s
becoming work; don&rsquo;t hesitate therefore to set them in the
way of doing it. I am sure that they will be glad enough to
follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By all the gods, Socrates, you are right. I dare say I
could borrow a little money to set the thing going; but to
tell you the truth, I did not like to run into debt, when all
the money would simply be eaten. It is a different thing,
now that there will be a chance of paying it back, and I have
no doubt that there will be some way of managing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at this point a little boy came up with a message for
Socrates. &ldquo;My mistress bids me say,&rdquo; he cried in a somewhat
undertone, &ldquo;that the dinner is waiting, and that you must
come at once.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are commands which all must
obey,&rdquo; said the philosopher with a smile, &ldquo;and this is one of
them. And indeed it would be ungrateful to the excellent
Xanthippe, if after hearing she has taken so much pains to
prepare one&rsquo;s dinner, one was to refuse the very easy return
of eating it. Farewell, my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the philosopher went his way.</p>

<p>To Callias the conversation which he had just heard was
peculiarly interesting, because the theory in his family was
that which was probably accepted in almost every upper
class house in Athens, that it was a disgrace for a free-born<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
woman to work for her living, and that all handicrafts,
even in those who constantly exercised them, were degrading
and lowering to the character. Xenophon already knew
what his master thought upon these points, but to his
younger friend this &ldquo;gospel of work,&rdquo; as it may be called,
was a positive revelation. He did not value it even when,
a few days later, he heard from Aristarchus that the experiment
had succeeded to admiration. &ldquo;I only had to buy a
few pounds of wool,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the women are as happy as
queens, and I have not got to think all day and night, but
never find out, how to make both ends meet.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>THE MURDER OF THE GENERALS.</small></h2>


<p>All this time a gloom had been settling down over the
Athenian people. The official despatch, which, as giving
details of the loss in the late engagement, was so anxiously
expected, did not arrive; but quite enough information to
cause a very general anxiety came to hand in various ways.
Private letters from men serving with the fleet began to be
brought by merchantships; and not a few persons were
found who had talked or who professed to have talked with
sailors and marines who had taken part in the action.
These written and oral accounts were indeed far from being
consistent with each other. Some were obviously impossible;
more were presumably exaggerated. But they were all
agreed in one point. Not only had there been a serious loss
of ships and men during the battle, but this loss had been
grievously aggravated by the casualties that had taken
place after the battle. It was pretty clear, unless the whole
of these stories were fictitious, that the second loss had been
more fatal than the first.</p>

<p>At last the long expected despatch arrived. It ran somewhat
in this fashion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The victory which, by the favor of the gods and the
good fortune of the Athenian people, we lately won over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Spartans and their allies at the Islands of Arginus&aelig; has
turned out to be no less important and beneficial to the
state than we had hoped it would be. The squadron of the
enemy that was blockading the harbor of Mitylene has disappeared:
nor indeed are any of his ships anywhere to be
seen. Our fleet, on the contrary, is stronger than it has
been for some years past; and we are daily receiving overtures
of friendship from cities that have hitherto been indifferent
or hostile. But this success has not been achieved
without loss. The late battle was long and obstinately contested,
and, as has been mentioned in a former despatch,
not a few of our ships were either disabled or sunk. We
did not neglect the duty of succoring the crews of the vessels
that had met with this ill-fortune, committing to officers
whom we knew to be competent, the task of giving such
help and assigning to them a sufficient number of ships.
At the same time we did not omit to make provision for a
pursuit of the enemy. But unluckily when the battle was
but just finished, a storm arose so severe that we could not
either rescue our friends or pursue our enemy. These then
escaped, and those, or the greater part of them perished,
having behaved as brave men toward their country.
Lists of those that have so died, so far as their names are
at present known, are sent herewith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this official communication, it will be seen, no blame
was laid on any person. The weather, and the weather
alone, was given as the cause of the disaster that had occurred.
But in their private communications with friends
at home the generals were not so reticent. They had commissioned,
they said, Theramenes and Thrasybulus to save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the shipwrecked men. If all that was possible had not been
done to execute this commission it was they and they only
who were to be blamed. Such words, even if they are intended
only for the private reading of the people to whom
they are written, seldom fail sooner or later to get out. In
this case so many people were profoundly and personally
interested in the matter that they got out very soon. And,
of course, among the first persons whom they reached were
the two incriminated officers, Theramenes and Thrasybulus.
It was a charge, hinted at if not exactly made, which no
man would allow to be made against him without at least
an attempt to refute it. Theramenes, who had come back
on leave not many days after the battle, at once bestirred himself
in his own defense. He was an able speaker, all the
more able because he was utterly unscrupulous; and he had
a large following of personal friends and partisans. On
the present occasion he was reinforced by the many citizens
who had lost relatives or friends in the late engagement.
These were furious and not without some cause. What had
been at first represented as a great victory had at length
turned out to be as fatal as a great defeat. They loudly demanded
a victim. Somebody, they said, must be punished
for so scandalous, so deadly a neglect. Theramenes had
the advantage of being on the spot, and of being able to
guide these feelings in a way that suited his own personal
interests. &ldquo;I was commissioned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to do the
work; I do not deny it. But the charge was given me when
it was almost too late to execute it, and I hadn&rsquo;t the proper
means at hand. I could not get hold of the ships that were
told off for this task, or of the crews who should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
manned them. If one of the ten had come himself to help
me, things might have been different. As it was, the men
either could not be found, or refused to come. A subordinate
must not be blamed for failing in what ought to have been
undertaken by a chief in command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These representations, in which, as has been seen, there
was a certain measure of truth, had a great effect. An assembly
was held to consider the contents of the second
despatch, and at this it was resolved, with scarcely an opposing
voice, that the generals should be recalled. They
were publicly thanked for the victory which they had won,
but they were suspended, at least for the present, in their
command, and successors were sent out to replace them.
Conon, as having been shut up at the time in Mitylene, and
being therefore manifestly clear of all blame in the matter,
was continued in office, and another of the ten had died.
Eight, therefore, were left to be affected by the decree. Of
these eight two determined not to run the risk of returning;
the other six sailed at once for home. Of these six Diomedon,
about whom something has been said already, was one.</p>

<p>As soon as was practicable after their arrival at Athens,
an assembly was held and they were called upon for their
defence. The chief speaker against them was Theramenes.
His colleague, Thrasybulus, stood by apparently approving
by his presence the charge that was brought but not
opening his mouth. One man among the accused men might
have easily secured his own safety at the expense of his
colleagues. If Diomedon had stood up and recapitulated
the advice which he had given in the council held after the
battle; if he had affirmed what none of his fellows would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
have been able to deny, &ldquo;I urged you to make the rescue of
the imperilled crews your first business, to use for it all the
means at your disposal, and to undertake it yourselves,&rdquo; he
must have been triumphantly acquitted, but he was of too
generous a temper thus to save himself. He chose to stand
or fall with his fellows. All, accordingly, put forward the
same defence, and it was in substance this: &ldquo;We did what
seemed best in our judgment. We detailed for the duty of
saving the crews what we considered to be an adequate
force, and put over it men whom we knew to be competent.
If Theramenes accuses us, we do not accuse him. We believe
that he was hindered from doing the duty intrusted to
him by the storm, and that if he had had double the number
of ships, even the whole fleet, at his disposal, he would
have been no less powerless to give the shipwrecked men
any effectual help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sincerity of tone about their defense which
was just the thing to win favor of such an audience as the
Athenian assembly. There were murmurs indeed. The
friends and kinsfolk of the drowned men could not endure
to think that no one would be punished for what they believed
to be a shameful neglect. But the general applause
drowned the dissenting voices, and the friends of the accused
began to hope that they were safe. If there had been
only a few more minutes of daylight, such might have been
the result. A show of hands was taken by the presiding magistrate,
and it was believed to be in favor of the accused, but
it was too dark to count; no regular decision could be made;
and the matter had to be adjourned to another meeting of
the assembly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>But now came another change in the impulsive, passionate
temper of the people. The next day or the next day
but one was the first of the great family festival of Athens,
the Apaturia, a celebration something like the Christmas
Day or the New Year&rsquo;s Day of the modern world. It was
one of the most cherished, as it was one of the most ancient
of the national festivals. All the great Ionic race, with
scarcely an exception, kept it, and had kept it from times
running back far beyond history. The family annals were
now, so to speak, made up, and consecrated by a solemn association
with the past. If a marriage had been celebrated
in the family during the year it was now formally registered;
if a son of the house had reached his majority his name
was now entered upon the roll. These formalities were
duly marked by customary sacrificing and sacrifices were
accompanied, as always in the ancient world, by festivities.
But family festivities are apt, as most of us know only too
well, to be marred by melancholy associations. It is delightful
to greet those that remain, but what of those who are gone?
And so it had been year after year, since the day when
Athens embarked on the fatal war which for nearly thirty
years drained her resources. So it was, in a special way, in
the year of which I am writing. The men whom Athens
had lost were not hired servants but sons. Every one, the
slaves only excepted, left an empty place in some family
gathering. And now for the first time the city realized the
greatness of her loss. The numbers had been known before;
but numbers, however startling, do not impress the mind
like visible facts, and now the visible facts were before the
eyes of all. The streets were filled with men and women in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
mourning garb, for the families which had suffered individually
assumed it. It seemed as if almost every passer by
had lost a kinsman. There could scarcely have been any
such proportion of mourners, but any uniform garb renders
the impression of being much more numerously worn than
is really the case.</p>

<p>And there can be but little doubt that the demonstration
was purposely exaggerated. For now came in the sinister influence
of political strife, which since the oligarchical
revolution of five years before had grown more than ever
bitter and intense. The accused leaders belonged to the
party of moderate aristocrats; a party loyal to the democratic
constitution of Athens, but disposed to interpret its
provisions in a conservative sense. The oligarchy hated
them, and Theramenes had been an oligarchical conspirator
before, and was about to be again. And the extremists
on the other side hated them. Between the two a plot was
concocted. Men who had no kinsfolk among the lost
soldiers and sailors were bribed or otherwise persuaded to
behave as if they had,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to come into the streets with black
clothes and shaven heads, and to swell the numbers of the
mourners, thus increasing the popular excitement.</p>

<p>Strangely enough it was the senate, the upper chamber of
the Athenian constitution that first gave this excitement an
expression. At the first meeting after the festival, Callixenus,
a creature of Theramenes&mdash;the man himself was probably
too notorious to take an active part&mdash;proposed a resolution
which ran as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For as much as both the parties in this case, to wit, the
prosecutor, on the one hand, and the accused, on the other
were heard in the late assembly, it seems good to us that
the Athenian people now vote on the matter by their tribes,
there being provided for each tribe two urns, and that the
public crier make proclamation as follows in the hearing of
each tribe: &lsquo;Let every one who finds the generals guilty of
not rescuing the heroes of the late sea fight deposit his
vote in Urn No. 1. Let him who is of the contrary opinion
deposit his vote in Urn No. 2.&rsquo; Furthermore it seems good
to us, that, if the aforesaid generals be found guilty, death
should be the penalty; that they should be handed over to
the Eleven,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and their property confiscated to the state, excepting
a tenth part, which falls to the goddess [Athene].&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Senate passed this resolution, though there was a
strong minority that protested against it. The assembly
was held next day, and Callixenus came forward again and
proposed his resolution as having received the senate&rsquo;s
sanction.</p>

<p>It was received with a roar of approval from the majority.
But there were some honest men who were not inclined to sanction
a proceeding so grossly illegal, for such indeed it was. One
of them, Euryptolemus by name, rose in his place, and spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an enactment which for many years has been
observed by the people of Athens for the due protection
of persons accused of crime. By this enactment it is
provided that every person so accused shall be tried
separately, and shall have proper time allowed him for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
preparation of his defence. Seeing then that the resolution
just proposed to the assembly contravenes this enactment by
providing that the accused persons should be tried altogether
and without such allowance of due time, I hereby give
notice that I shall indict Callixenus its proposer for unconstitutional
action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A tremendous uproar followed the utterance of these
words. &ldquo;Who shall hinder us from avenging the dead?&rdquo;
cried one man. &ldquo;Shall this pedant with his indictment
stand between the Athenian people and their desire to do
justice?&rdquo; shouted another. But the excitement rose to its
height when a man clad as a mariner forced his way
through the crowded meeting, and struggled by the help of
his companions into the <i>Bema</i>, the platform or hustings
of the place of assembly.</p>

<p>It was a strange figure to stand in that place from which
some of the famous orators and statesmen of the world had
addressed their countrymen. He was evidently of the lowest
rank. His dress was ragged and soiled. His voice, when
he spoke, was rough and uncultured. Yet not Pericles himself
who so often speaking from that place</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;Had swayed at will that fierce democracy,&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">ever spoke with more effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of Athens,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I was on the <i>Cheiron</i>. I was
run down by a Corinthian ship just before the battle came
to an end. The <i>Cheiron</i> sank immediately; I went down
with her, but managed to get free, and came up again to the
surface of the water. I saw a meal-tub floating by me, and
caught hold of it. Some ten or twelve men were near me.
They kept themselves up for a time by swimming, but sank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
one by one. I spoke to several of them, and bade them
keep up their spirits, because the admirals would be sure to
rescue us. No help came. At last only one was left. He
was my brother-in-law. I made him lay hold of the other
side of the meal-tub; but it was not big enough to keep us
both up. He let go of it again. He said to me &lsquo;Agathon&rsquo;&mdash;that
is my name&mdash;&lsquo;you have a wife and children; I am
alone. Bid them remember me; and tell the men of Athens
that we have done our best in fighting for our country, and
that the admirals have left us to perish.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was the man telling the truth, or was he one of those historic
liars that have made themselves famous or infamous
for all time by the magnitude of the fictions that they have
invented just at the critical time when men were most
ready to accept them.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Whether it was true or false, the story roused the people
to absolute fury. Thousands stood up in their places and
shook their fists at the accused, and at the orators who had
spoken in their favor, while they screamed at the top of their
voices, &ldquo;Death to the generals! death to the murderers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A momentary silence fell upon the excited crowd when
a well-known orator of the intense democratic party threw
himself into the hustings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose that the names of Euryptolemus and of all
those who have given notice of the indicting Callixenus be
added to the names of the accused generals, and be voted
upon in the same way for life and death.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The speaker added no arguments; and the roars of approval
that went up from the assembly showed sufficiently that
no arguments were needed. The advocates of constitutional
practice were cowed. It was only too plain that to persist
would surely be to meet themselves the fate of the accused.
Euryptolemus was a brave man, and as we shall
soon see, did not intend to desert his friends; but for the
present he gave way. &ldquo;I withdraw my notice,&rdquo; he cried,
reflecting doubtless that he could renew it when the people
should become more ready to listen to reason and justice.
But there was still another constitutional bulwark to be
thrown down. The presiding magistrates refused to put
the motion to the assembly. Their chief (or chairman as we
should call him) rose in his place. He was pale and agitated,
and his voice could not be heard beyond the benches
nearest to him when he said, &ldquo;The motion of Callixenus is
against the laws, and we cannot put it to the assembly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They refuse! they refuse!&rdquo; was the cry that went from
mouth to mouth. Again the rage of the multitude rose to
boiling point, and again the popular orator saw his opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose,&rdquo; he said, appearing again in the hustings,
&ldquo;that the names of the presiding magistrates be added to
those of the accused in the voting for life and death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shout of approval more vehement than ever greeted this
announcement. Once more the policy of concession, or
shall we say of cowardice prevailed. The magistrates conversed
a few moments in hurried whispers, and then advanced
to the railings in front of their seats. It was immediately
seen that they had yielded, and loud applause followed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hail to the popular magistrates! Hail to the friends of
the people!&rdquo; was the universal cry. But one was still
sitting in his place. His colleagues turned back to bring
him. They talked, they gesticulated, they laid hold of
him by the arms; they were trying to force him out of his
seat. He heeded them not; to all persuasion he returned
the same answer: &ldquo;I am set to administer the laws, and
will do nothing that is contrary to them.&rdquo; The most of the
house could, of course, hear nothing of what was being said;
but they could see plainly what had happened. &ldquo;Socrates
refuses! Socrates refuses!&rdquo; was now the cry, followed by
shouts of &ldquo;Death to Socrates!&rdquo; &ldquo;Death to the blasphemer!
death to the atheist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The philosopher sat unmoved, and his colleagues made no
further attempt to persuade him. They took what was,
perhaps, the only possible course under the circumstances&mdash;for
they had not all the martyr-like temper of Socrates&mdash;and
put the question without him. It was carried by a
large majority.</p>

<p>The presiding magistrate, having announced the result of
the vote, went on: &ldquo;Seeing that it has seemed good to the
Athenian people to try the generals accused of negligence in
saving the lives of citizens, the said generals are hereby put
upon their trial. If they, or any citizen on their behalf,
wish to address the assembly, let them or him speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It might have been thought that the furious crowd which
had been ready to overpower with violence the advocates of
constitutional practice would have howled down any who
dared to advocate so unpopular a cause. But it was not
so. The majority, having swept away, as they thought,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the trammels of technicality, in their eagerness for justice,
had no wish to disregard justice by refusing a hearing to
persons on their defense. Whatever the faults of the Athenian
democracy, it was at least ready to hear both sides.
When therefore Euryptolemus rose to address the assembly
on behalf of the generals, an instantaneous silence followed;
nor was he interrupted during the delivery of his
speech except, it may be, by occasional murmurs of approval.
He spoke as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of Athens, I have three things to do now that I address
you. First, I have to blame in some degree my dear
friend and kinsman Pericles, and my friend Diomedon;
second, I have to plead somewhat on their behalf; third, I
have to give you such advice as will in my judgment best
advantage Athens. I blame them because they, through
their generous temper, have taken upon themselves the
fault which, if it exists, lies upon others. For indeed what
happened after the battle was this: Diomedon advised that
the whole fleet should proceed to the relief of the disabled
ships and their crews. Herasinides counselled that the
whole fleet should be sent in pursuit of the enemy.
Meranylus declared that both duties might be discharged
together, part being sent against the enemy, and part to
help the shipwrecked men. And this last course was actually
taken. Forty-seven ships were told off for this duty.
Three, that is, from each of the eight divisions, ten belong to
private captains, ten that were from Samos, and three
that belonged to the commander-in-chief. And three ships
were committed to the charge of Thrasybulus and Theramenes,
the very men who now bring these charges against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the accused. Yet these men I do not even now, on behalf of
the generals, myself accuse. I allow that the violence of
the storm prevented them from executing this order which
had been given them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So far then, men of Athens, do I blame the accused, and
I do plead for them. And now let me venture to give you
some advice. Give these men time, if it be but one day
only, to make their defence. You know that there is yet a
form of law by which it is enacted: &lsquo;If any person hath
aggrieved the people of Athens, he shall be imprisoned and
brought to a trial before the people; and in case he be convicted,
he shall be put to death and thrown into the pit, his
goods and chattels to be confiscated to the state, reserving a
tenth part for the goddess.&rsquo; By this law try the accused.
Give to each a separate day and try them in due
order. So will you judge them according to the law, and
not seem, as verily you will seem if you adopt the resolution of
Callixenus, to be allies of the Laced&aelig;monians, by putting
to death the very men who have taken twenty of their ships.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why indeed are you in such vehement haste? Are you
afraid to lose your hold of life and death? That right no
one doubts or threatens. Should you not rather be afraid
lest you put an innocent man to death? One man do I say,
nay many innocent men? And lest, afterwards repenting
of your deed, you shall reflect how ill and unjustly you
have acted? Forbid it, ye gods, that the Athenians should do
any such thing. Take care, therefore, I implore you, that
you, being successful, do not act as they often act, who are
on the brink of despair and ruin. Only those who are
without hope insult the gods; yet somehow you will insult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
them, if instead of submitting to them on points that are
subject to their will alone, you condemn those men who failed
because it was the pleasure of the gods that they should
fail. You would do more justly if you honor these men with
crowns of victory rather than visit them with this punishment
of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A visible effect was produced by this speech. That the
republic should put to death its successful generals almost
in the moment of victory seemed to many to be the very
height of folly, even of impiety. The gods had favored
these men. To lay hands upon them would be an insult to
heaven. But supposing they had erred, would it be well
for the state to deprive itself of the services of its most skillful
servants? This seemed the common sense view. The
question was: would it prevail against the sticklers for
law, those who were hardened by the sense of personal
loss, and the unscrupulous partisans who were ready to
seize any pretext for destroying political opponents? The
voters filed past the balloting urns, and dropped their
votes as they passed. No one could guess what the result
would be, for no one could watch more than one of the ten
pairs of urns&mdash;a pair to each tribe&mdash;which were placed to receive
the suffrages. The process took no little time, and
then when it was finished, there was the counting, also a
long and tedious process. It was almost dark when the
tables were finished.</p>

<p>In the midst of a profound silence the presiding magistrate
stood up. It was now dark, and his figure was thrown
into striking relief by the lamps with the help of which the
votes had been counted. He read the numbers from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
small slip of paper.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> &ldquo;There have voted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
condemnation 3254, for acquittal 3102.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sensation produced by the announcement was intense.
Not a few who had voted &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; already half repented
of what they had done. Indeed the reaction which
ended in the banishment and ultimately the death by starvation
of the author of the proposal may be said to have
begun at that moment. The general excitement rose to a
still higher pitch when the officers of the Eleven, the
magistrates to whose custody condemned criminals were
handed, were seen making their way, lighted by slaves
holding torches, to the place where the accused were sitting.
There was not one of the six whose features were not familiar
to many in the assembly. More than one had tendered
distinguished service to Athens; and one, Pericles, son of
the great statesman by Aspasia, bore a name which no
Athenian could pronounce without some emotion of pride
and gratitude. It so happened that it was he on whom the
officers laid hands. Something like a groan went up from
the crowd; but it was too late to undo what they had done,
and it was too early for the repentance that had already
begun to work to have any practical effect. The six were
led off to immediate execution.</p>

<p>Callias anxious to say a few words of farewell to his
friend and kinsman Diomedon had hurried round, as soon
as he heard the announcement of the numbers, to the door
by which he knew the condemned would be taken from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
place of assembly. The president of the Eleven who was
conducting the matter in person, as became an occasion so
important, allowed a brief interview.</p>

<p>The young man was so overcome with grief that he could
only throw himself into the arms of his friend and cling to
him in speechless agony. Diomedon, on the contrary, was
perfectly calm and collected. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this
has ended as badly as I thought that it would&mdash;you will remember
what I said to you after the battle. For myself,
this that I am about to suffer is scarcely a thing to be lamented.
It is hard indeed to have such a return for my services
to Athens; and I would gladly have served her again. It
has not so seemed good to the Athenians. Let it be so. I
am delivered from trouble to come. I would not have fled
from them willingly, but if my countrymen compel me,
why should I complain? That at least Socrates has taught
me not to do. And this day has at least brought this good,
that no one can doubt hereafter that he believes what he
says. For you, my son, I have but one word. Do not
despair of your country. A grateful child pays his dues
of nurture even to an impassive mother. And now farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour afterwards he and his colleagues were lying
mangled corpses at the bottom of the pit.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>RESCUED.</small></h2>


<p>The execution of the generals was a blow of such severity
that Callias was absolutely prostrated by it. As a patriotic
Athenian he felt overwhelmed both with shame and with
despair. That his country should be capable of such ingratitude
and folly, should allow private revenge or party spite
to deprive her of the generals who could lead her troops to
victory made it impossible to hope. The end must be near,
for the gods must have smitten her with the madness
which they send upon those whom they are determined to
destroy. And then he had loved Diomedon almost as a son
loves a father. Left an orphan at an early age he had found
in this kinsman an affectionate and loyal guardian; and he
had made his first acquaintance with war under his auspices.
He had in him a friend whom he felt it would be
quite impossible to replace.</p>

<p>For some days Callias remained in strict seclusion at
home, refusing all visitors, and, in fact, seeing no one, except
the aged house-steward, who had been now the faithful
servant and friend of three generations of his family.
Even when Hippocles himself, on the fifth day after the
disastrous meeting of the assembly, sent in an urgent request
that he might be allowed to see him, the steward was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
directed to meet him with the same refusal. The old man
contrary to his custom of prompt and unhesitating obedience,
lingered in the room after he had received this answer,
and was obviously anxious to speak. &ldquo;Well! Lycides,&rdquo;
said the young man, his attention attracted even in the
midst of his preoccupation by this unusual circumstance,
&ldquo;What is it? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be well, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;if you would
see the worthy Hippocles. He declares that the affair of
which he is come is one of the very highest importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias simply shook his head.</p>

<p>The steward began again, &ldquo;Oh! sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callius interrupted him. &ldquo;You are an old man, and a
friend whom my father and my grandfather trusted, and I
would not say a harsh word to you. But if you will not
leave the room, I must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. He had never heard
his young master speak in such a tone before. Still he
would not go, without making another effort.</p>

<p>He rapidly advanced to where his master was sitting, his
face buried in his hands, and throwing himself on the
ground, caught the young man by the knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I implore you, by the gods, and
by the memory of your father and your grandfather, who
both died in my arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak on,&rdquo; cried Callias. &ldquo;It seems I am not my own
master any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! sir,&rdquo; the old man continued, &ldquo;your liberty, your
life is in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words, uttered as they were in a tone of conviction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that could not be mistaken, startled the young man out of
the indifference which his profound depression had hardened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have known it since yesterday at noon,&rdquo; the steward
replied, &ldquo;and have been anxiously thinking over with myself
how I could best make it known to you. And now
Hippocles has come to say the same thing. For the sake of
all the gods, trust and listen to what he has to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him in, if you will have it so,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>Hippocles came into the room with outstretched hands
and caught the young man in a close embrace. The
warmth and tenderness of this greeting had the happiest
result. Callias was moved from the stupor of grief which
had overwhelmed him. Bowing his head on his friend&rsquo;s
shoulder, he burst into a passion of tears,&mdash;for tears were a
relief which the most heroic souls of the ancient world did
not refuse to themselves. His friend allowed his feelings to
express themselves without restraint, and then as the violence
of the young man&rsquo;s emotion began to subside, he put
in a few words, instinct with heartfelt sympathy, about
the friend whom they had lost. Thus, with his usual
tact, he waited for Callias himself to open the subject in
which he now felt sure his interest had been aroused. It
was soon after that the young man asked: &ldquo;What is this
that old Lycides has been saying about my liberty and
life being in danger? He has known it, he says, since yesterday,
and you know it too. What can he mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is quite right,&rdquo; replied Hippocles. &ldquo;He knows
something and I know something. Now listen. Your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
parting with Diomedon was observed. The men who
murdered him&mdash;and by all the gods! there never was a
fouler murder done in Athens&mdash;cannot but look for vengeance
to come upon them. To avoid it or to postpone it they
will stick at nothing. No near friend or relative of their
victims is safe. I know&mdash;for I have friends in places you
would not think&mdash;mark you, I <i>know</i> that your name is
among those who will be accused in the next assembly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accused,&rdquo; cried Callias, &ldquo;accused of what? Of being
bound by kindred and affection to one of the noblest of men.
By heavens! let them accuse me. I should glory to stand
and defend myself on such a charge. If I could only tell that
villain Theramenes what I think of him I should be afraid
of nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I thought you would say,&rdquo; replied
Hippocles, &ldquo;nor can I blame you. But have patience.
Theramenes will get his deserts if there are gods in heaven
and furies in hell. But have patience. Leave his punishment
to them. But meanwhile don&rsquo;t give him the chance of
burdening his soul with another crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do then?&rdquo; asked Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly from Athens,&rdquo; replied his older friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! fly, and leave these traitors and murderers to enjoy
their triumph! Not so; not if I were to die to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young friend, you will help your country,
which, in spite of all her faults, you wish, I presume, to
serve, and avenge your friends all the more surely if you will
yield to the necessities of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t press me any further: it would be a dishonor to
me to leave Athens now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The argument was continued for some time longer; but
Hippocles could not flatter himself with the idea that he
had made any impression. At last he seemed to abandon
the attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a willful man must have his way. I
can only hope that you will never live to repent it. But
you will not refuse to come and see us&mdash;my daughter adds
her invitation to mine&mdash;you will not be so ungallant as to
refuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I should not think of refusing,&rdquo; said Callias. &ldquo;You
have called me back to life. I thought that my heart would
have burnt with grief and rage. You can&rsquo;t imagine what
your sympathy is to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hippocles, &ldquo;show your gratitude by dining
with us to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias promised that he would, and accordingly at the
time appointed presented himself at the merchant&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>After dinner the discussion was resumed. Hippocles and
Hermione urged all the arguments that they knew to persuade
the young man to think of his own safety, but they
urged in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the young man, as he rose to take his leave,
&ldquo;no, I thank you for your care for me, but your advice I
may not follow. I refuse to believe that the Athenian people
can keep the the base and ungrateful temper which they
showed the other day. It was the madness of an hour, and
they must have repented of it long ago. If they have not,
then an honest man who happens to be born into this
citizenship had best die. Athens is no place for him. Anyhow,
I shall try, at the very next assembly, unless I can get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
some other and abler man than I am to do it for me, to
indict Callixenus for unconstitutional practices. Did I pass
by this occasion of vengeance, the blood of Diomedon and
his brave colleagues might well cry out of the ground
against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several days passed without any disturbing incident.
Callias had warnings indeed. Mysterious letters were
brought to him, bidding him beware of dangers that were
imminent; more than one stranger who found him in the
streets let fall, it seemed by the merest accident, words that
could not but be meant to give a warning; friends spoke
openly to the same effect; but the young man remained unmoved.
At the table of Hippocles, where he was a frequent
guest, the subject was dropped. It seemed to be conceded
by common consent that Callias was to have his own way.</p>

<p>He was returning to his home in the upper city from the
Piraeus on a dark and stormy night, picking his way under
the shelter of one of the Long Walls<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> when he felt himself
suddenly seized from behind. So suddenly and so skilfully
made was the attack that in an instant the young man,
though sufficiently active and vigorous, was reduced to absolute
helplessness. His arms were fastened to his side; his
legs pinioned; his eyes blindfolded, and a gag thrust into
his mouth. All this was done without any unnecessary
violence, but with a firmness that made resistance impossible.
The young man then felt himself lifted on to some
conveyance which had been waiting, it seemed, in the neighborhood,
and driven rapidly in a northerly direction. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
much the prisoner could guess from feeling the wind which
he knew had been coming from the east, blowing upon his
right cheek. After being driven rapidly for a few minutes
the gag was removed with an apology for the necessity
that had compelled its use. The journey was continued
with unabated and even increased rapidity, the lash, as
Callias&rsquo; ear told him, being freely used to urge the animals
to their full speed. Before long the sound of the waves
breaking upon the shore could be distinctly heard above the
clatter of the horses&rsquo; hoofs and the grinding of the chariot
wheels upon the road. Then came a stoppage. The prisoner
was lifted from his seat and put on board what he guessed
to be a small boat. He felt that this was pushed out from the
land, that it began by making fair progress, and that not
long after starting, when it had passed, as he conjectured
beyond the shelter of some bay or promontory, it began to
meet bad weather. The waves were breaking, it was easy
to tell, over the boat, in which the water was rising in spite
of the efforts of the men who were busy bailing to keep it
under. It was time for our hero to speak; so busy were the
sailors in struggling with their difficulties, that they might
easily have forgotten their prisoner, and let him go to the
bottom like a stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you had best let me help you and
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Poseidon! I had forgotten him,&rdquo; he heard one of
the men cry. &ldquo;If he drowns there will be no profit to us
in floating.&rdquo; A consultation carried on in low, rapid whispers
followed. It ended in the prisoner&rsquo;s bonds being severed,
and the bandage being removed from his eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>When the situation became visible to the young Athenian
it was certainly far from encouraging. The boat was low
in the water, and was getting lower. It was evident that it
could not live more than a few minutes more. The night
was dark, and the sea so high that even the most expert
swimmer could not expect to survive very long. The only
hope seemed to lie in the chance of being blown ashore.
But obviously the first thing to be done was to prepare for a
swim. Callias, accordingly, threw off his upper garment
and untied his sandals. This done he waited for the end.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming. The boat was too low in the
water to rise to the waves, and one of unusual size now
broke over and swamped it, immersing the crew, who numbered
nine persons including Callias. Happily they were
good swimmers, and if speedy help were to come, might
hope to escape. And, luckily, help was nearer than any of
them had hoped. A light became visible in the darkness;
and the swimmers shouted in concert to let the new comers
know of their whereabouts. An answering shout came from
the galley, for as may be supposed, it was a galley that carried
the light. &ldquo;Be of good cheer,&rdquo; shouted a voice which
Callias thought that he recognized. The swimmers
shouted in answer, and felt new hope and new life infused
into them. But the rescue was no easy task. Each man in
turn had to fasten under his armpits a rope with a noose at
the end which was thrown to him, and was then drawn
up the side of the galley. This took time. Some of the men
found it hard to do their part of the work, and so delayed
the rescue of the others. By the time that Callias was
reached, and he was the last of the nine, he was almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
beyond the reach of help. By one supreme effort, however,
he managed to slip the rope about him. As he was
dragged on to the deck the last conscious impression that he
had&mdash;and so strange was it that he thought it must be a
dream&mdash;was the face of Hermione bent over him with an expression
of intense anxiety.</p>

<small>THE VOYAGE OF THE SKYLARK.</small></h2>


<p>It was not long before Callias recovered his consciousness;
but he was so worn out by excitement and fatigue, coming
as they did after the exhausting emotions through which he
had passed since the death of the generals, that he found it
impossible to rouse himself to any exertion. The yacht,
which as my readers will have guessed was that excellent
sea-boat the <i>Skylark</i>, had never been in any danger, though
she had had to be very skillfully handled while she was engaged
in picking up the swimmers. This task accomplished,
her head was put northward, and before very long she had
gained the shelter of Eub&#339;a. Callias guessed as much when
he found that she ceased to roll, and gladly resigned himself
to the slumber against which he had hitherto done his best
to struggle. He slept late into the morning; indeed it
wanted only an hour of noon when at last he opened his
eyes. The first object that they fell upon was the figure of
Hippocles, who was sitting by the side of his berth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it was not a dream,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I
thought I saw your daughter on board last night, but could
not believe my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is on board,&rdquo; said Hippocles, with a slight
smile playing about the corners of his mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me what it all means. I was seized in the streets
of Athens, pinioned, blindfolded, and gagged. I was carried
off I know not where, thrown into a boat, as nearly as
possible drowned, and now, when I come to myself, I see
you. Surely I have a right to ask what it means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Callias,&rdquo; replied Hippocles, &ldquo;I have always
tried to be your friend, as it was my priviledge to be your
father&rsquo;s before you. You will allow so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I shall never forget
how much I owe you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, trust me for an hour. I will not ask you to
do anything more. If you are not fully satisfied then, I
will make you any redress that you may demand. I know
that you have a right to ask for it. I know,&rdquo; he added with
an air of proud humility that sat very well upon him, &ldquo;that
Hippocles the Alien is asking a great favor when he makes
such a request of Callias the Eupatrid,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> but believe me I do
not ask it without a reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Athenian could do nothing else than consent
to a request so reasonable. Some irritation he felt, for there
was no doubt in his mind that Hippocles had had something
to do with the violence to which he had been subjected.
The intention, however, had been manifestly friendly,
and there might be something to tell which would
change annoyance into gratitude.</p>

<p>A sailor now brought him some refreshment, and when this
had been disposed of, another furnished him with some
clothing. His own, it will be remembered, he had thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
away, when preparing to swim for his life. His toilet completed,
he came up on deck and found Hippocles and his
daughter seated near the stern. Both rose to greet him. He
could not fail to observe that Hermione was pale and agitated.
The frank friendliness of her old manner, which,
blended as it had been with a perfect maidenly modesty,
had been inexpressibly charming, had disappeared. She
was now timid and hesitating. She could not lift her eyes
when she acknowleged his greeting. He could even see that
she trembled.</p>

<p>The young man stood astonished and perplexed. What
was this strange reserve of which he had never before seen a
trace? Was there anything in himself that had caused it?
Had he&mdash;so he asked himself, being a modest young fellow
and ready to lay the blame on his own shoulders&mdash;had he
given any offence?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him the story, father,&rdquo; she said, after an anxious
pause during which her agitation manifestly increased,
&ldquo;tell him the story. I feel that I cannot speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My little girl has a confession to make. In a word, it is
her doing that you are here to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her doing that I am here to-day,&rdquo; echoed Callias, his
astonishment giving a certain harshness to his voice.</p>

<p>The girl burst into tears. Callias stepped forward, and
would have caught her hand. She drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him, father, tell him all,&rdquo; she whispered again in
an agitated voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;if I must confess your
misdeeds, I will speak. You know,&rdquo; he went on addressing
himself to the young Athenian, &ldquo;you know how we vainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
sought to persuade you to leave Athens. I had a better and
stronger reason for speaking as I did than I could tell you.
From private information, the source of which I could not
divulge, if you had asked it, as you probably would have
done, I had found out that you were in the most serious
danger. Not only were you to be arrested&mdash;so much you
know&mdash;but having been arrested, you were to be put out of
the way. You talked of answering for yourself before the
assembly, even of accusing your enemies and the men who
murdered your friends. You never would have had the
chance. There are diseases strangely sudden and fatal to
which prisoners are liable, and there was only too much
reason to fear that you would be attacked by one of them.
There are other poisons, you know, besides the hemlock,
which the state administers to the condemned, and an adverse
verdict is not always wanted before they are given.
Well; we were at our wits&rsquo; end. You were obstinate&mdash;pardon
me for using the word&mdash;and I would not tell you the
whole truth. Even if I had, it was doubtful, in the temper
of mind you were in, whether you would have believed me.
Then Hermione here came to the rescue. &lsquo;We must save
him,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;against his will.&rsquo; &lsquo;How can we do that?&rsquo;
I asked; and I assure you that I had not the least idea of
what she meant. &lsquo;You must contrive to carry him off to
some safe place.&rsquo; I was astonished. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;a
free citizen of Athens.&rsquo; &lsquo;What will that help him, with the
men who are plotting to take his life?&rsquo; she answered. Then
she told me her plan. I need not describe it to you. It was
carried out exactly. Now can you forgive her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! lady&rdquo;&mdash;the young man began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; cried Hippocles. &ldquo;I have something
more to say, before you pronounce your judgment. You
must take into account that if she has erred, she has already
suffered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! father,&rdquo; interrupted the girl, &ldquo;it is enough; say
nothing more. I am ready to bear the blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she sank back into her seat and covered her face with
her mantle.</p>

<p>Hippocles went on: &ldquo;I say she has suffered. We did not
reckon on that unlucky wind. It was bad enough to have
carried you off against your will; but when it seemed that
we might drown you as well, that looked serious. I was
not much afraid, myself. I felt pretty sure that we should
be able to pick you up. But still there was a chance of
something going wrong. And she, of course, felt responsible
for it all. It was true that it was the only way of saving
you&mdash;that, I swear by Zeus and Athene, and all the gods
above and below, is the simple, literal fact&mdash;but still, I must
own, it was a trying moment, and if anything <i>had</i> happened&mdash;Then
you were the last to be picked up, and just
at the last moment, something went wrong. The clumsy
fellow at the helm&mdash;I ought to have been there myself, but
I wanted to help in getting you on board&mdash;the clumsy fellow
at the helm, I say, gave us a wrong turn. We should
have had a world of trouble in bringing the <i>Skylark</i> about
again. Hermione saw it, sprang to the tiller, and put things
right&mdash;I have always taught her how to steer. So you really
owe her something for that. I don&rsquo;t exactly say that she
saved your life, but you might have been in the water a
little longer than you liked. Well, it was trying to the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
girl. I can imagine how she felt; but she bore up till
we got you on board. Then she fainted; for the very first
time in her life, I give you my word, for she is not given to
that sort of thing. Now, say, can you forgive her and us?
We really did it for the best, and thanks to Poseidon, it has
ended pretty well, so far, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is no case for forgiveness,&rdquo; cried the young Athenian
earnestly; &ldquo;it is a case of gratitude which I shall never
exhaust as long as I live. I am a headstrong young fool, a
silly child, in fact, and you were quite right in dealing with
me as grown people must deal with a child, help it and do it
good against its will. Forgive me, lady,&rdquo; he went on, and
kneeling before her chair, he took one of her hands in his
own, and carried it to his lips.</p>

<p>So far all was well. A bold achievement had ended happily,
but the situation was a little strained, to use a common
phrase, and Callias, like the well bred gentleman that he
was, felt that it would be a relief to the girl if it was brought
to an end. Happily, too, at that moment the ludicrous side
of the affair struck him, and it was without any affectation
that he sprang to his feet and burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that you have captured me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
is your pleasure? What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go where you please,&rdquo; said Hippocles. &ldquo;Even
if you want to return to Athens I will not hinder you. But
my plan is this, subject of course, to your consent. Come
with me as far as Thasus. I have business there, to look after
my vineyard, or rather the vintage. My people, I find, are
sadly apt to blunder about it. This will take me no little
time, and while I am engaged there, the <i>Skylark</i> shall take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
you on to Alcibiades&rsquo; castle in Thrace. I was going to say
that I would commend you to him. But that will not be
necessary. He is, you know, a distant kinsman, and is hospitality
itself. In my judgment he has had hard usage. It
would have been better for Athens, if she had trusted him
more. But all that is past. Meanwhile I think that his
castle is the safest place for you just now. You and he are
very much in the same case, I fancy. Athens has not
treated either of you fairly and yet you wish well to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your plan seems a good one,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;let me
think it over for a few hours. Anyhow you shall have my
company as far as Thasus, if you will accept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Skylark</i> was making headway gaily
through the well-sheltered waters that lie between Eub&#339;a
and the mainland of Greece. When the shelter ceased the
wind had fallen, shifting at the same time to the south-west.
Nearly two hundred miles had yet to be traversed
before Thasus could be sighted, and this was accomplished
without accident or delay. The time of year was later than
a Greek seaman commonly chose for a voyage of any duration,
for it was the latter end of October, and the ninth of
November was the extreme limit of the sailing season.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Hippocles, however, was more venturesome in this way than
most of his contemporaries, and his confidence was rewarded
by a most pleasant and prosperous voyage. So blue were the
cloudless skies, so deep the answering color of the seas,
that it was only when the travellers saw the sunset tints on
the forest-clad ridge of Thasus&mdash;&ldquo;the ass&rsquo;s back-bone laden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with wood,&rdquo; as it was called&mdash;that they remembered that
summer had long since given place to autumn.</p>

<p>Two days were spent in a visit to the vineyard which Hippocles
had come to inspect, and then Callias, who had soon
concluded to follow his friend&rsquo;s advice, resumed his voyage.
The course of the <i>Skylark</i> was now south-easterly. The
voyage had all the interest of novelty for him, for he had
never before visited these waters. When the <i>Skylark</i>
started at early dawn there was a mist which contracted
the horizon. As this cleared away under the increasing
power of the sun the striking peak of Samothrace became
visible in the distance. All day its bold outlines became
more and more clearly defined. On the following morning&mdash;for
the good ship pursued her course all night&mdash;it had been
left behind, but another height, not less striking in appearance,
and even more interesting in its associations, the snow-capped
Ida, at whose feet lay the world-famed Trojan plains,
took its place. As evening fell the <i>Skylark</i> was brought to
land at the western end of the Hellespont, the rapid current of
which could be better encountered by the rowers when they
had been refreshed by a night&rsquo;s rest. Progress was now somewhat
slow; and it was on the afternoon of the fourth day
after the start from Thasus that the cliffs of Bisanthe and
the northern shore of the Propontis came in sight. This was
our hero&rsquo;s destination, for it was here that Alcibiades, after
quitting Athens in the previous year, had fixed his abode.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>ALCIBIADES.</small></h2>


<p>The sun was just setting when the <i>Skylark</i> cast anchor
about two hundred yards from the shore and opposite
the castle with which the loftiest point of the cliffs was
crowned. The signal flag which the captain ran up to his
mast-head was answered by another from the castle, and in a
few minutes a boat was seen to start from a little quay which
had been built out into the sea at the foot of the cliff. Callias
had written a letter to Alcibiades in which he briefly described
himself and his errand, and Hippocles, though
modestly depreciating the value of any thing that he could
say, had also written, at the young man&rsquo;s request, a letter of
introduction. These documents were handed over to the
officer in charge of the boat, and conveyed by him to the
castle. After a very short delay the boat returned again,
this time in the charge of an officer of obviously higher
rank. This higher personage mounted the side of the
<i>Skylark</i>, and after giving a courteous greeting to Callias, delivered
to him an invitation from Alcibiades to make his
castle his home for as long a period as he might find it convenient
to stay there, explaining at the same time that his
master would have come in person to welcome his guest, if
he had not been detained by business of importance with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
neighboring chief. The young Athenian&rsquo;s baggage&mdash;for
he had been liberally fitted out by the thoughtful and generous
care of Hippocles&mdash;was transferred to the boat, and
in a few minutes more he had set his foot on the landing-place.</p>

<p>He had been speculating as he neared the shore, about the
way in which the castle was to be approached. An observer
looking from the sea might have thought that there was no
way of getting to it except by scaling the almost perpendicular
base of the cliff. Once landed on the quay, however, the
traveller discovered that a passage had been cut through the
cliff. This passage, which could be closed at its lower end by
a massive door, was something like a winding staircase. It
was somewhat stifling and dark, though light and air were
occasionally admitted by holes bored to the outer surface of
the rock. Its upper end opened in to a courtyard round
which the castle was built. The approach from the sea was,
it will have been seen, sufficiently secure. On that side indeed
the castle of Bisanthe was absolutely impregnable.
From the land, it was, to say the least, safely defensible. It
was approached by one narrow ridge, so formed that a few resolute
men could hold it against a numerous body of assailants.
The walls were lofty and massive, and so constructed that a
galling fire of missiles could be kept up on either flank of an
attacking force.</p>

<p>Callias was escorted to his chamber by a young Thracian
slave, who informed him in broken speech that a bath room
in which he would find hot and cold water was at his service,
and further that his master hoped to have the pleasure
of his company at supper in an hour&rsquo;s time. The chamber,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
it may be said, was furnished with a clepsydra, or water-clock,
marked with divisions.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Callias awaited his introduction to his host with no little
curiosity. Alcibiades was, as has been said, a kinsman of
his own, and he had heard of him&mdash;what Athenian, indeed,
had not,&mdash;but he had never happened to see him. Callias&rsquo;
father had been an aristocrat of the old-fashioned type, and
had so strongly disapproved of his cousin&rsquo;s reckless and extravagant
behavior that he had broken off all intercourse
with him, and had been particularly careful that his son
should never come in contact with him. Callias was about
fourteen when Alcibiades left Athens in command (along
with two colleagues) of the Sicilian expedition. The absence
thus begun lasted about eight years. For the first half of
this time he was an exile; for the second half in command of
the fleets and armies of Athens, but still postponing his return
to his native city. Then came his brief visit, lasting it
would seem, only a few days,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and at that time Callias, as
it happened, had been absent in foreign service. He was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in what was or should have been, the prime of life, having
just completed his forty-fourth year, but the dissipation of
his youth and early manhood and the anxieties of his later
years had left their mark upon him, and he looked older
than his age. Yet there were traces of the brilliant beauty
that in earlier days had helped to make him the spoiled
darling of Athens. The wrinkles had begun to gather
about his eyes, but they were still singularly lustrous, and
could either flash with anger, or melt with tenderness. His
temples were hollow and his cheeks had somewhat fallen in;
but his complexion was almost as brilliant as ever, while
the abundant auburn curls that fell clustering about his neck
had scarcely a streak of gray in them.</p>

<p>His greeting to his guest was more than courteous. It
was affectionate, exactly such as was fitting from an older
to a younger relative. Indeed then, as ever afterward during
their acquaintance, Callias was greatly struck by the perfection
of his manners. It seemed impossible that the
stories told of his haughty insolence by which in former years
he had made himself one of the best-hated men in Athens
could possibly be true.</p>

<p>Supper was announced shortly after Callias had been
ushered into the chamber. Alcibiades took his guest by the
hand, led him into the dining-room, and assigned him a
place next to himself. Some other guests were present.
Two of these were officers in the military force which Alcibiades
maintained in his stronghold; the third was an aged
man, who had been his tutor many years, and for whom he
retained an affection that was honorable to both master
and pupil. The fourth was the Thracian chief with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
whom Alcibiades had been engaged when the <i>Skylark</i> arrived.</p>

<p>The meal was simple. The chief feature was one of the
huge turbot for which the Euxine was famous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would have cost a fortune in the fish market at
Athens,&rdquo; said the host pointing to the dish, &ldquo;even if it
could have been procured at all. Here a fisherman thinks
himself well paid for such a monster by three, or at the
most, four <i>drachmae</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>A piece of venison and a platter of quails were the other
dishes. The second course consisted of a maize pudding and
some sweet-meats.</p>

<p>During the repast the conversation turned speedily on
local matters, and was carried on (but not till after a courteous
apology had been offered to the young Athenian) in the
bastard Greek largely mixed with Thracian words, in
which the chief was accustomed to express himself. The
meal ended, a handsome silver cup was handed by the
major-domo, a venerable looking man, who made the comfort
of his master and his most honored guests his special care.
Alcibiades took it and poured out a few drops upon the
table, uttering as he did so, the words: &ldquo;To Athene the
Champion.&rdquo; This was equivalent to the loyal toasts of an
English banquet. He then took a very moderate draught, the
wine being unmixed, in obedience to the rule which demanded
that all wine used in religious ceremonies&mdash;and this libation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
was such a ceremony&mdash;should be pure.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He then tipped the
cup to each guest in turn. All were equally moderate, for it
was not the custom, even for a Greek drunkard, it may be
said, to drink his wine unmixed. But when the cup came
to the Thracian chief he drank a deep draught as if the
liquor had been liberally diluted. Callias who had never
been at table with a Thracian before, watched the man with
amazement. He saw that while the other guests were supplied
with the usual mixtures of wine and water the chief
remained steadfast in his devotion to the undiluted liquid,
and that he emptied his cup at a draught, and that the cup
itself was of an unusual capacity. Nor did the drinker seem
affected by these extraordinary potations, except that his
voice became louder, and his manner more boastful. At
last, however, and that without a moment&rsquo;s notice, he
rolled over senseless on his back. So sudden was the
change that it suggested the idea of a fit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo; he whispered in some alarm, to his
neighbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill? not a whit. It is the way in which he always
finishes his evenings. His slaves will carry him to bed, and
he will awake to-morrow morning without the suspicion of
a headache. Bacchus, I verily believe, has a special favor
for these fellows, and, truly, they do worship him with a
most admirable earnestness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Thracian&rsquo;s collapse was the signal for breaking up the
party. Callias and the old tutor, Timanthes by name,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
declined to drink any more, and the two officers, who were
on duty for the night, departed to make their round.
Strong as was the place Alcibiades omitted no precautions
for its safe custody. Timanthes, who was old and feeble retired
to rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me to my own room,&rdquo; said Alcibiades to his
guest, &ldquo;we shall be here alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chamber to which he led the way was little like what
one would have expected to find in free-booter&rsquo;s stronghold,
for really the castle of Bisanthe was more of that than anything
else. Art and letters were amply represented in it.
On one wall hung a panel painting<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> by Polygnotus, a
masterly composition, of that serenity, that ethical meaning,
as the great critic Aristotle expresses it, which was
characteristic of the artist. This represented the gods in
council at Olympus. It was faced on the opposite wall
by an exceedingly graceful painting from the hand of
Xeuxis, Aphrodite and the Graces, and a spirited picture by
the same artist, of the duel between Ajax and Hector.
There were other works by men of less note. Sculpture
was represented by only a single specimen, a bust of
Socrates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paintings are easily carried about,&rdquo; Alcibiades afterwards
explained to his guest, &ldquo;but sculpture is inconveniently
heavy. You will understand that a man in my
situation has always to be ready for a move; and I always
like to have two or three really good things that I
can always take with me. One bust, indeed, I have indulged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
myself with, that of my old teacher. Ah! if I had heard him
to more purpose, I should not be here! You know him,
of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias said that he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent likeness! is it not? Who would think that
such features concealed a soul so divinely beautiful? Did
you have any talk with him when you were in Athens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;and I admired above all things
his practical wisdom. But what was that to what I afterwards
saw of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he went on to relate how the philosopher stood firm,
though in imminent peril of his life, and had steadfastly refused
to put the unconstitutional proposal of Callixenus to the
assembly.</p>

<p>Alcibiades heard the story with uncontrollable delight.
He started up from his seat, and walked up and down the
room with flashing eyes. &ldquo;Tell me everything about it,&rdquo;
he said, and he insisted upon the repetition of every detail.
&ldquo;That is magnificent,&rdquo; he cried, when his curiosity had
been satisfied. &ldquo;That is exactly what one would have expected
from Socrates. I suppose that it is the very first
time that he ever acted as presiding magistrate&mdash;he had
never been so, I know, when I left Athens, nor have I
heard of his having been since&mdash;and that first time he did
what nobody else dared to do. You say that the others
gave way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;they stood up against it at first,
but gave in afterwards. Socrates was absolutely alone, and at
last they put the question without him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just like him,&rdquo; cried Alcibiades with enthusiasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He is simply the bravest and most enduring man alive.
I could tell you stories about him that would astonish you.
We served together in the campaign at Potid&aelig;a. Indeed we
were in the same mess. When we had short commons, as
we had many a time, there was no one like him in holding
out. He seemed to be able to go without food altogether,
but when we had plenty, he could enjoy it as well as anybody.
We had a foolish way, as young men will, of making
people drink whether they wished it or not. But nothing
ever affected Socrates. No one ever saw him one whit the
worse for what he had taken. And as for the way in which
he bore cold, it was absolutely incredible, only that
one saw it with one&rsquo;s own eyes. The winters here are terrible,
as you will find out, if, as I hope you will, you stop with
me, but he used to make nothing of them. During the
very hardest frost we had, when every one who could, stayed
in doors, and those who were obliged to go out, wrapped
themselves till you would hardly know them, he wore
nothing but his common cloak, and went absolutely barefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once, I remember, something came into his mind.
That was in the early morning. Well, he stood trying to
think it out till noon, and from noon he went on till
evening. Some Greeks from Asia wanted to see how long
this would go on; so, after dinner, they brought out their
mattresses, and took up their quarters for the night in the
open air&mdash;it was summer-time, you must understand. Some
of them slept, and some watched him, taking it by turns.
Their report was that he stood there till morning, and the
sun rose, and that then he made a prayer to the sun, and so
went to his quarters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;His courage, too, is astonishing. In one of the battles
at Potid&aelig;a he saved my life. I had been wounded
and must infallibly have been killed, if it had not
been for him. He took me up and carried me off to our
line. The generals gave me the prize for valor, when they
ought, by right, to have given it to him. But they took account
of my family and rank, and curiously enough, he was
just as anxious as they were that I should have it and not
he. Then at Delium, again, when the day went against us,
and the army was in full retreat. I was in the cavalry; he
was serving as a foot soldier. Our men would not keep together,
and he and Laches&mdash;he was killed, afterward, at
Mantinea&mdash;were making the best of their way back. I rode
up to them and told them to keep up their courage and I would
not leave them. A cavalry soldier has, you know, a great advantage
in a retreat. There was no need to tell Socrates to
keep up his courage. Laches, I could see, though a brave
enough man, was terribly frightened; but Socrates was as
cool as a man could be. He held up his head finely, and
marched steadily on. It was plain enough to see that anyone
who meddled with him would find out his mistake.
The end of it was that he got back safe, and brought Laches
back safe also. The fact is that at such times it is the men who
are in a hurry to get away that are cut down. I do not
think that there ever was a braver man than Socrates. And
what you have just been telling me bears it out. A man
may be brave enough in battle and be timidly frightened
when the assembly is howling and raging against him.
This has been a dismal business of the generals and I have
never been so near despairing of my country, as I have since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
I heard it. How is it possible to help a city that makes
such a requital to those who save her? But still, while there
are men like Socrates in her, all is not lost. But no more now;
you must be weary, and ready to sleep. There will be plenty
of time hereafter to talk. And now farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<small>BISANTHE.</small></h2>


<p>Life at Bisanthe would, in any case, have been remarkably
attractive to Callias. The taste for sport was
hereditary with him, as it was with most Athenians of his
class. But, ever since his boyhood, circumstances had been
altogether adverse to any indulgence of it. For a quarter of a
century an Athenian&rsquo;s life had been perforce a city life.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The country outside the walls was not available for
when it was not actually in the occupation of a hostile
army, it was still in a state of desolation. Game, it is probable,
had almost disappeared from it. It had long been too
thickly populated for the larger animals to exist in it.
These the sportsman had been obliged to seek in the mountain
regions of Phocis, Doris, and Thessaly. Now the smaller
such as the hare, always reckoned a special dainty in
Athens, could scarcely be found, even when it was possible to
seek for it. Callias was delighted to find a totally different
condition of things at Bisanthe. Here there were to be
found fierce and powerful animals the pursuit of which gave
something of the delightful excitement of danger, the bear,
the wild-boar, and the wolf. Lion, too, could be sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
seen, though they were not so common as they had been
some eighty years before when the army of Xerxes, marching
through this very region, had had so many of the camels
attacked and killed by them. Our young Athenian highly
appreciated this abundance of noble game. He had had no
experience, indeed, in the huntsman&rsquo;s craft, but he became
fairly expert at it. He was an excellent rider; this accomplishment
was a necessary part of the education of a well-born
Athenian. He was expert in all martial exercises, especially
in the use of the javelin and the spear; and, above all, he
had a cool courage which his warlike experience by land and
sea had admirably developed.</p>

<p>But there were more serious matters than sport to occupy
him. The relation of his host to his neighbors, both Greek
and barbarian, was of curious interest to a thoughtful young
man. He had heard something of it at Athens, for Alcibiades
was a much talked of personage, all of whose movements
were earnestly, even anxiously, discussed both by friends
and foes. Now he was, so to speak, behind the scenes, and
saw and heard much that the outside world did not know
or did not understand. The neighbors with whom his host
came in contact, friendly or unfriendly, were three. There
were the Greek cities along the northern coast of
the Propontis; there was Seuthes, the king of Thrace;
a potentate whose kingdom had many uncertain and
varying boundaries, and there were the free or independent
Thracians. Between these last and Alcibiades
there was constant war. Accustomed for centuries to
plunder their neighbors, they now found themselves repaid
in their own coin. At the head of a picked force, highly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
disciplined and admirably armed, Alcibiades harried their
country with an audacity and a skill which made
his name a constant terror to them. The Greek cities,
on the other hand, were uniformly friendly. Before
his coming they had been sadly harrassed and distressed by
their barbarian neighbors. They had not been able to call
anything beyond their walls exactly their own, and even
their walls had sometimes scarcely sufficed to protect them.
All this was altered by the military genius of this remarkable
man. The robber bands which had been accustomed to
ride unchecked up to their fortifications were now compelled
to keep at a respectful distance from them, and not only the
cities themselves but their territories were practically safe.
Land which it had been impossible to cultivate at all, or
from which only a precarious crop could be snatched with
imminent danger to the cultivator, was now covered with
prosperous farms and pleasant homesteads. For this protection,
enabling them as it did to save the exhausting expense
of imported food, the cities were willing to pay, and
considerable sums which were practically a tribute, only
much more cheerfully paid, came regularly into the
treasury at Bisanthe, and enabled its master to keep up a
numerous and efficient force.</p>

<p>As for King Seuthes, his relations with the powerful
stranger who had settled on these his territories were more
doubtful. He was not an enemy, but he certainly was not
a friend. All that Alcibiades could do in weakening the
independent Thracians was altogether to his mind.
Let them be weakened enough, and they would gladly seek
protection by becoming his subjects. On the other hand he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
did not approve the idea of any one but himself becoming
the patron of the Greek cities on his coast. What they
were willing to pay for protection ought to come, he felt,
into his coffers, not into those of an interloping adventurer.
Meanwhile he was content to remain on outwardly good
terms with the master of Bisanthe, and to await the development
of events.</p>

<p>In the little town of the same name that was dominated
by the castle of Bisanthe, the young Athenian found some
pleasant society. He was the more at home in it because it
was an Ionian colony, and the inhabitants were akin to
him in race and sympathies. They had the same culture, a
quality that always flourished more kindly in the Ionic
branch of the Hellenic race. Plays of the great dramatists
of his own country were performed in a small but well appointed
theatre, and there was at least one circle in the
town in which literary topics were discussed with interest
and intelligence.</p>

<p>The resources available in the way of native society were
not great. Thracian habits in general were not unfairly
represented by the behavior of the chief to whom my readers
were introduced in the last chapter. Their hard drinking
habits had already made them notorious throughout Greece.
Our hero accordingly kept away from the entertainments
which his host felt it a matter of policy to attend. The one
great social function at which he assisted was the marriage
of a prince who was nearly related to King Seuthes.
Athenian habits were commonly frugal. Their public
buildings, whether for political or religious purposes, were
splendid in the extreme. On these, and on the ceremonies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of worship, they were accustomed to spare no expense. But
their private expenditure was, as a rule, not large. Our
hero was proportionately astonished at the profusion which
prevailed at the wedding festivities of the Thracian
Caranus. There were twenty guests. Each as he entered
the banqueting chamber had a circle of gold put upon his
head, and in taking his place was presented with a silver
cup. These and indeed all the dishes, plates, and cups with
which the guests were furnished during the entertainment,
were supposed to become their actual property. A brass
platter, covered with pastry, on which were birds of various
kinds, was put before each, and after this another of silver,
furnished with a variety of fresh meats. These disposed of&mdash;they
were just tasted and handed to the slaves who stood
behind the guests&mdash;two flasks of perfume, one of silver, the
other of gold, fastened together with a link of gold, were
distributed. Each flask held about half a pint. Then came
a piece of quite barbarous extravagance&mdash;a silver gilt charger,
large enough to hold a porker of considerable size. The
creature lay on its back with its belly stuffed with thrushes,
the yolks of eggs, oysters, scollops, and other dainties. The
carrying capacity of the slaves was nearly exhausted, and
the bridegroom received a hearty round of applause when he
ordered his guests to be supplied with baskets, themselves
richly ornamented with silver in which they might carry
away his bounty.</p>

<p>At this point Alcibiades and his friend made an excuse to
depart. &ldquo;Caranus,&rdquo; said the former, as they returned to
Bisanthe, &ldquo;must have embarassed himself for life by this
silly extravagance. He must have borrowed money largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
before he could indulge in all this silver-ware, for though
his estates are large, he is far from being wealthy. But it
is a point of honor with these people to go as near to ruining
themselves as the money-lender will permit them, when
they celebrate a birth, a wedding, or a funeral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Callias found the chief interest of the months which
he spent at Bisanthe in the frequent conversations which
he held with his host. In these Alcibiades expressed himself
with the utmost freedom and frankness. What he said
was in fact at once a confession and an apology, the substance
of them may be given as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard I dare say very much evil of me, and I
cannot deny that much of it is perfectly true. It ill becomes
a man to complain of circumstances, for everyone, I take it,
can make his own life and if he goes to ruin has only himself
to blame for it. Yet the gods, or fate, or whatever it is
that rules the world, were certainly adverse to me from the
beginning. My father fell at Coronea when I was but a
mere child, and the loss of a father is especially damaging
when his son is rich and noble. Every one seems to agree
in spoiling the boy, the lad, the young man, who is the
master of his own fortune. I know that I was fooled to the
top of my bent. However, that is all past, and the free man
who lets others turn him about to their own purposes has
nothing to say in his own defence; and I had at least one
good thing on my side of which if I had been so minded I
might have made good use. Socrates never wearied of convicting
me out of my own mouth of folly and ignorance,
and he knew my great weakness and told me of it in the
most unsparing fashion. I remember once how he convicted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
me of what I know has been the great fault of my life. &lsquo;If,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;you can convince the Athenians that you deserve
to be honored as no man, not even Pericles himself deserved,
if you gain an equal name among the other Greeks and
barbarians, if you cross over from Europe and meddle
with matters in Asia, all these things will not satisfy
you. You desire to be nothing less than master of the
whole human race.&rsquo; That perhaps was somewhat exaggerated,
but I certainly have had big schemes in my head,
bigger than I ever had, or could hope to have, the means of
carrying out. My hopes took in all Greece, Persia, Carthage,
the Western barbarians who inhabit the shores of the ocean,
and I know not what else. It was too great a structure to build
on the slight foundation of an Athenian dock-yard; it was
piling Olympus and Ossa and Pelion on the hill of
Hymettus, and such structures are sure to fall even without
the thunder-bolt of Zeus. Yet it is only fair to myself
to say that in my ambitions I did think of my country
as well as of myself; and I think that I have not always had
fair play in carrying them out. There was the expedition to
Sicily, for instance. I suppose that no one will ever speak of
it but as a piece of hair-brained folly into which I was the
means of leading Athens. Looked at by the event, it seems
so, I allow, and yet it might have succeeded. Indeed it was
within an iota of succeeding, and this though the people
showed the incredible folly of putting as senior in command,
a man who hated the whole business. Even Nicias almost
took Syracuse. If they had only left me without a colleague
or with colleagues who would have yielded to my
counsels! But what did they do? Just at the critical time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
they recalled the man whom everyone in the expedition, from
the first to the last, identified with its success; and why did they
recall me? On that trumpery charge of having broken
the Herm&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> You would like to ask me, I know, whether
I had anything to do with the matter. No; I had not, but I
could have told them all about it if I had had the chance. As
it was, they were ready to listen to any one but me. Why,
there was an outrageous liar came forward, and declared he
had seen the whole thing done by the light of the moon;
and on the night it was done there was no moon at
all. But I had enemies, personal enemies who would stick
at nothing as long as they could injure me. And here I
must confess a fault, a fault that has been fatal to me. I deserved
to have enemies. I made them by my annoyance
and insolence; and if they ruined me, and, as I think, my
country with me, I have only myself to blame. You
would like to know how I justify myself for what I did after
my banishment, for getting Sparta to help Syracuse against
my own country? I do not justify myself at all. It was
madness, tho&rsquo; it was only too successful. But it made me
frantic to think what a chance, what a splendid opportunity
for myself and for Athens, the fools who were in power at
home were throwing away. No; on that point I have
nothing to say for myself. But since then I have honestly
tried to do the best that I could for the city. And if the
Athenians could only have trusted me and had had a
little more patience, I believe that I could have saved them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
But it is always the same story with them; they must have
what they want at once, and if they don&rsquo;t get it, some one
has to suffer. How could they expect that I could put right
at once all that had been going wrong for years?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the substance of what Alcibiades said to his
guest on the many occasions on which they discussed these
matters, said of course, with a variety of details and a
wealth of illustration, which it is impossible to reproduce.
More than once Callias asked his host what were his views
and expectations of the future of the war. He found that
Alcibiades did not take a cheerful view of the prospects of
the campaign that would be soon beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was always afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the victory at
Arginus&aelig; would be only a reprieve, a postponing of the
evil day. The effort which Athens then made was too exhausting
to be repeated&mdash;her next fleet will be nothing like
as good as the last, and the last had hard enough work to
win the day. And then there was the disastrous folly and
crime of putting the generals to death. Mind, I don&rsquo;t say
that they were not to blame; but I do say that to kill the
only good officers the city had, even if they had deserved
death ten times more than they did, was mere madness.
Whom have they got to put in their place? Conon is a man
who knows his business and would do his duty, but as for
the rest,&rdquo; he went on, anticipating a witticism which was
made many hundred years afterwards by an English statesman,
&ldquo;I can only say that I hope they will inspire the
enemy with half the terror with which they inspire me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>&AElig;GOS POTAMI.</small></h2>


<p>Alcibiades had established a system of communication
with all the principal stations in the &AElig;gean which gave him
early information of what was going on.</p>

<p>Early in the new year (405) intelligence reached him at his
castle, that Lysander was coming out from Sparta to assume
the command of the allied fleet. This news affected Alcibiades
very considerably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I anticipated this,&rdquo; he said to his guest after the evening
meal on the day when the news had reached him, &ldquo;and it
is the worst thing that could have happened for Athens.
There was just a chance that the Spartans, who, happily for
us, are very stupid and obstinate, would stick to their
rule that no man should be appointed naval commander-in-chief
thrice. But they had, as I heard from a friend in
Chios, a very strong requisition from the allies to appoint
Lysander, and so they have sent him out again, saving
their rule by appointing a nominal chief, a man called Arrachus,
who, of course, is a mere figure head. Now Lysander
is by far the ablest man that the Spartans have got; he
is quite unscrupulous; he is a bitter enemy of ours; and what
is worst of all, he can do anything that he pleases with
Cyrus. You have not been campaigning for two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
years without finding out that the Persian money bags are
the real weights that make the scales of fate go up and
down. Last year Callicratidas was crippled because Cyrus,
at this very Lysander&rsquo;s request, kept his purse strings
tight. Now everything will be straight and easy, and before
two months are over the Spartans will have as good a fleet
as money can make.&rdquo; The year wore slowly on. The
long Thracian winter, which Callias, though not unused to
cold weather in Athens found exceedingly severe, yielded at
last to spring, and spring in its turn to summer. All the
while the news which reached Bisanthe continued to have
a gloomy complexion. At Miletus, as well as in other of
the mainland towns, thorough-going partisans of Lysander
were installed in power. Cyrus had been called
away to Upper Asia, where the old king, his father,
was lying sick to death, and had left all his treasuries at the
disposal of the Spartan admiral. With this supply of money
the pay of the sailors had been increased, and new ships
had been laid down on the stocks. In March the Athenian
fleet sailed for the seat of war. It was larger than
any that had been sent forth by the city in recent
years, for it numbered no less than one hundred and
eighty ships; but private letters gave an unfavorable
account of the way in which it was equipped, and officered.
This adverse opinion continued to be borne
out by the news that arrived from time to time of its doings.
It seemed to be moving about aimlessly and fruitlesly, always
behind, always in the wrong place. It offered
battle to Lysander, who lay in harbor near Ephesus, but in
vain. The wary Spartan had no mind to fight but at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
own time, and the Athenian admirals had no way of compelling
him. Then the ships were scattered in plundering
expeditions along the mainland coasts and among the
islands which had accepted the Spartan alliance. The gain
was small, for the booty was insignificant, but the demoralization
and relaxation of discipline were great. About midsummer
followed a bold maneuver on the part of Lysander.
He sailed across the &AElig;gean to the coast of Attica, where
his sudden appearance caused no little consternation. The
Athenian commanders were as usual behind hand. If they
had heard of this movement as soon as they ought, and had
been ready to follow immediately, it is quite possible
that they might have inflicted a damaging blow on their
adversaries. As it was, the news was long in reaching
them, and when it came, found them with their fleet scattered
and unprepared. Accordingly they missed their chance of
forcing Lysander to an engagement off an hostile shore, an
engagement, too, which he would hardly have been able to
decline. Lysander crossed and recrossed the &AElig;gean without
molestation, and shortly afterward sailed northward.</p>

<p>Alcibiades, whose intelligence department was, as has
been said, admirably organized, received information that
this movement was intended, and in consequence took up
his quarters at a little fort which he possessed at the extremity
of the Chersonesus. He and his guest had not been
there more than a day when the Spartan fleet came in sight.
He watched it pass at a distance of two or three miles,
with eager interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have a very formidable appearance,&rdquo; he said to
Callias when he had scanned with his practical eye every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
detail of their equipment. &ldquo;I shall be agreeably surprised
if our ships have anything as good to show.&rdquo; On the following
day the Athenian fleet appeared, showing only too
plainly how just had been Alcibiades&rsquo; forebodings.
The effects of wind and weather&mdash;the ships had now been
nearly six months at sea&mdash;were plainly visible; the sails,
which, as there was a slight breeze from the west, they used
to assist their progress, were dirty and ragged; the rowers
were deplorably out of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things,&rdquo; he said to his companion, &ldquo;are even worse
than I expected; that fleet will be no match for its enemy,
except under far more skillful management than it is likely
to have. Still let us hope for the best; and it may be possible
to give our friends some good advice, if they will take
it.&rdquo; This, unfortunately, was the last thing that the
Athenian admirals, certainly incompetent, and probably
traitorous, were willing to do. The progress of events,
briefly described, was this:</p>

<p>Lysander possessed himself, by a sudden attack, of the
town of Lampsacus, which was in alliance with Athens.
This conquest put him in possession of abundant supplies,
and of what was more valuable, a safe and convenient base
of operations. While securing these material advantages,
he also, with a generosity which he could always assume on
occasion, allowed the Lampsacenes to go unharmed. He
gained thus not only a strong position but a friendly population.
On the other hand the position occupied by the
Athenians was by no means so favorable. They moved
their fleet to the mouth of a little stream known by the
name of &AElig;gos Potami, or the Goat&rsquo;s River. This spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
was directly opposite Lampsacus&mdash;the Hellespont here is
somewhat less than two miles broad&mdash;but it had no conveniences
for the purpose for which it was chosen. There
was no harbor, the anchorage was indifferent, there were no
houses in the neighborhood, and the nearest point from
which supplies could be obtained was the town of Sestos,
nearly two miles distant.</p>

<p>The opportunity for offering advice which Alcibiades had
foreseen had now occurred, and he promptly took advantage
of it. The morning after the arrival of the fleet, he rode,
with Callias in his company, to the spot where the Athenian
generals had pitched their headquarters, and requested an
interview. He was introduced into the tent which they
used for purposes of consultation, and saw the two officers,
Menander and Tydeus by name, who happened to be
detailed that day for duty on shore.</p>

<p>They received him with a coldness and hauteur which
augured ill for the success of his mission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to offer you a piece of
advice which, from my knowledge of the country, I feel
sure will be useful. Transfer your fleet from this position,
which, you must allow me to say, has nothing to recommend
it, to Sestos. You must go to Sestos for your supplies; why
not stay there altogether. The harbor is good and you will
be able to do what you please, fight, or not fight, as it may
seem best. Here, if it comes on a blow from the south and&mdash;you
will remember that the equinox is near&mdash;you will be in
a very awkward predicament; and, anyhow, I do not see
how you are to keep your men together when they have to
forage in this manner for supplies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are obliged to you for the trouble you have taken in
coming,&rdquo; said Menander, &ldquo;but you must allow us to remind
you that it is we, and not you whom the Athenian people
have appointed to the command of this fleet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gods prosper you in it,&rdquo; replied Alcibiades with
unruffled coolness. &ldquo;And now, farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done all that I could,&rdquo; observed Alcibiades to
his companion, who had been expecting his return outside
the tent. &ldquo;Now we can only await the event. As for
these men, I would say of them that the gods strike with
madness those whom they are determined to destroy, but
for one thing. There may be a method in their madness.
They may <i>mean</i> to bring about a disaster. In a word they
may have sold their country. It is a hard thing to say of
any man, but could any admiral, not being a madman or a
traitor, keep his fleet in such a place as this? And yet I do
not know. I have seen honest men act with a folly so outrageous
that one could not help suspecting something more.
Let us go home, and prepare for the worst. But stay&mdash;there
is yet a chance. There is Conon. He must know better
than this. Will you see him? I cannot, for there is too
deadly a feud between us. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;I was with him last year when he
was shut up in Mitylene, and he sent me with despatches
to Athens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you go to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if it would not seem too presumptuous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can give your authority; he will understand why
I did not come myself; and he is too sensible not to listen
to good advice from whomsoever it may come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conon was on board his ship in which he was practicing
some maneuvers about half a mile from the shore. The
young Athenian was rowed out to see him, and returned in
about an hour. The report which he brought back was
this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conon was very reserved, but courteous. He wished
me to thank you for your message, and to say he was sure
you wished well to Athens. He would do what he could,
but he was only one out of many, and he might be out-voted.
Anyhow, he would keep his own men from straggling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Alcibiades, &ldquo;we have shot our last bolt, let
us go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some days the two companions waited for news in a
suspense that they often felt to be almost beyond bearing.
One night&mdash;it was the night of the fifteenth of September&mdash;they
had watched through the hours of darkness till the day
began to show itself in the eastern sky. Both had felt the
presentiment that their waiting was about to end, though
neither had acknowledged it to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it never coming?&rdquo; said the elder man, as he rose from
his seat, and looked from the window across the sea, just
beginning to glitter with the morning light. In a moment
his attitude of weariness changed to one of eager attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried to Callias. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; and he
pointed to a boat that had just rounded the nearest point to
the westward. It was a fishing boat, manned, apparently,
by seven or eight men, and making all the speed it could
with both oars and sails. The two men hurried down to the
castle pier, and awaited the arrival of what they were sure
was the long expected message.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The boat was still about two hundred yards away when
Alcibiades recognized the steersman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it is old Hipparchus.&rdquo; And he waved
his hand with a friendly gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a bad news he brings,&rdquo; he said again after a quiet
pause, &ldquo;he makes no reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few more strokes brought the boat alongside of the pier.
Alcibiades reached his hand to the steersman, and helped
him to disembark. That his errand was bad was only too
evident from his look. He was deadly pale, and in his eyes
was the expression of one who had lately seen some terrible
sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all over,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Athens is lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few minutes the three men stood silent. Perhaps it
was then that Alcibiades felt the keenest remorse of his life.
After all, it was he who, more than any living man, had
brought this ruin to his country. He had led her into an
enterprise which overmatched her strength; and he had
suggested to her enemies, the too successful policy that had
ended in her overthrow. If Athens was indeed lost it was
his doing&mdash;and yet he loved her. Much of this the younger
man could guess at, for he had not been at Bisanthe for now
nearly a year without learning something of his host&rsquo;s inner
thoughts. He turned away his face unwilling to witness the
emotion which he felt could be seen in the other&rsquo;s countenance.
The messenger from the scene of the disaster stood
with downcast eyes, absorbed in the dismal recollections of
what he had lately witnessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us how it happened,&rdquo; said Alcibiades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For five days,&rdquo; so he began, &ldquo;we manned our ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
every morning about the third hour, formed them in line
of battle, and moved across the strait to the harbor of
Lampsacus. The Spartan fleet was ranged in line outside
the harbor with their army drawn up upon the shore on
either side. Our admirals did not venture to attack; and so
we sailed back. I noticed that a few quick-sailing galleys
followed us at about half a mile distance. When we got
back to our station, our men used to scatter in search of provisions
for their noonday meal&mdash;our commissariat, you must
know, was very ill-supplied. Some went up the country,
but most made their way to Sestos. None of our admirals,
except Conon, seemed to have a notion that this was dangerous,
though some of us old sailors could have warned
them if we had dared. Conon always kept his men together.
Well, on the fifth day&mdash;our men, you must understand,
had been growing more and more careless&mdash;about an
hour after we got back, a shield was run up to the masthead
of one of the Spartan swift-sailing galleys. I saw it flash in
the sunshine; and a few moments afterwards the whole
Spartan fleet rowed from their anchorage and made their
way across the strait. They caught us entirely unprepared.
There was no battle; scarcely a blow was struck. I can
easily believe that they did not lose a single man. Some of
our ships they found absolutely deserted. None of them
had more than two-thirds of their complement. No, I
should not say none; twelve were ready, Conon&rsquo;s eight and
four others, one of which was the Parelus.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> I was on board<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Menander&rsquo;s own ship, of which I was steersman. There
were eight others with me. We hurried as fast as we could
to Sestos. There, the next day, I was able to hire this boat,
and thought the best thing that I could do was to come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that twelve ships escaped,&rdquo; said Alcibiades,
&ldquo;how many then were taken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a hundred and seventy,&rdquo; answered the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how many prisoners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, but certainly several thousand. Before
we came away, a boat from Lampsacus brought an awful
story of what had been done there. All the Athenian
prisoners were put to death, between three and four thousand.
Only the admiral Adeimantus was spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see,&rdquo; cried Alcibiades, &ldquo;he was the traitor.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>TO PHARNABAZUS.</small></h2>


<p>There was little sleep that night for the inhabitants of
the castle of Bisanthe. Every one felt that the situation
was full of peril. If it had not been for the confidence which
every one brought into contact with Alcibiades felt in his
capacities of leadership there would have been something
like a panic. As it was, the garrison awaited with calmness,
though not without intense anxiety, the course of action
which their commander would take for himself, and recommend
to them. They were not kept long in suspense.</p>

<p>Shortly after dawn the notes of a trumpet were heard
through the castle giving the well known signal by which a
general assembly of the garrison was called. A few minutes
sufficed to collect the men. The meeting was held in the
central court of the castle, and Alcibiades, taking his stand
on the topmost step of an outside staircase which led up to
one of the chambers, addressed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have heard of the disaster by
which Athens has lost its last fleet. I will blame no man for
what happened or inquire whether it might not have
been averted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker was interrupted by loud cries of &ldquo;Long live
Alcibiades, the invincible!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flush of pleasure passed over the speaker&rsquo;s face, but he
made a gesture imperative of silence, and continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing that remains for us is to consider what it
is most expedient to do. Here, my friends, we cannot stay.
Bisanthe indeed, protected by its situation, its walls, and
stout hands and tried valor, it would not be easy to take.
But, with both sea and land hostile, with all the country
and cities from which we have drawn our supplies in the
hands of the Spartans, we cannot long continue to hold it.
What then shall we do? You, my friends, I can only advise,
for from this day I of necessity cease to command. Go,
then, I would say, to King Seuthes, and offer yourselves to
him. He will receive you kindly. Brave men&mdash;and your
valor has been shown times without number&mdash;are always
valued and honored by him, and now that, for a time at
least, the Spartans and their allies have became supreme in
these parts, he will want men more than ever. If you require
it, you shall have my good word; but your reputation
will speak for you more effectually than I can. My gratitude
to you, who have served me so well, I can never express.
Yet such return as I can make shall not be left undone.
The paymaster will pay you all arrears of pay, with
a donation of thrice as much again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud burst of applause followed this announcement.</p>

<p>The speaker continued: &ldquo;This gift would be many times
greater, if my means were equal to my sense of your courage
and your services. From some of you I have a favor to
ask. It is not expedient publicly to declare my plans;
but I may say that I shall need a few associates in them.
For these I shall not ask you, not because I am doubtful of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
raising them, but because I know that you would all offer
yourselves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A roar of assent went up from the whole assembly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already exercised the choice which in any case
I should have been compelled afterwards to make. Twelve
companions&mdash;more I am forbidden by circumstances to take&mdash;will
go with me. To the rest I say, &lsquo;Farewell.&rsquo; The gods
grant that at some happier time we may again render our
service to Athens and to Greece. Till then, Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud answering cry of farewell went up from the men,
which was renewed again and again as the speaker entered
the room at the head of the staircase. Here the twelve
chosen associates were assembled, Callias and Hipparchus,
the messenger from the scene of the late conflict, making
up the number to fourteen. Alcibiades addressed them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have long since anticipated and prepared myself for
this misfortune which has now overtaken us, though the
blow has fallen more suddenly and more heavily than I had
feared. To you, my chosen friends, I reveal the counsels
which it would not have been expedient to publish to a
multitude. Briefly they are these: Lysander has conquered
by the help of the Persians, for had it not been for the
gold of Cyrus, his fleet could never have been kept together.
We also must go to the Persians for help. It is an evil necessity,
I confess, that makes free-born Greeks court the favor
of their slaves; but a necessity it is. And the time favors us
for using it. Cyrus covets the throne of Persia which he
claims against his elder brother Artaxerxes as having been
born after his father&rsquo;s accession whereas Artaxerxes was
born before it. As Lysander, then, has used Cyrus against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
us, so we must use Artaxerxes against Cyrus. &lsquo;How,&rsquo; you
will ask, &lsquo;is Artaxerxes to be approached?&rsquo; Through
Pharnabazus, the Satrap, with whom I have a warm friendship
of now some years&rsquo; standing. To Pharnabazus, therefore,
I now purpose to go. I shall demand of him that
which he will himself be most willing to grant&mdash;for he is no
friend to Cyrus&mdash;that he send me up to Susa. This Themistocles
did before me; but he, at least in word, went as the
enemy of his country, though indeed he was unwilling to
harm it. I shall go, both in word and in deed, as its friend.
And now for other things. For my most valuable possessions
I have prepared hiding-places. Much I shall leave to King
Seuthes, to whom I sent a message concerning my immediate
departure. This morning, my friends, I would ask you
to receive at my hands a year&rsquo;s pay. Do not hesitate to receive
it; I can give it now, I may not be able so to do a year
hence. We will start this day at sunset. There is no time
to be lost. To-morrow, I doubt not, or the next day at the
latest, Lysander will be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Callias, after the rest had departed to make preparations
for their departure, Alcibiades had some private conversation
as to the subject of ways and means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must let me be your banker,&rdquo; he began by saying.</p>

<p>Callias thanked him heartily, but declined to receive anything
more than would suffice for immediate needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may as well take it,&rdquo; returned his host, &ldquo;there is a
good deal more here than I can take with me; and why
should you not? For myself, I carry most of my possessions
about with me in this fashion,&rdquo;&mdash;and he showed a leather
purse filled with pearls and precious stones. &ldquo;Gold is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
too cumbrous to carry in any quantity. This no man will
take as long as I am alive. Besides this, my worthy friend
Hippocles, who, as you know, is as trustworthy as the treasury
of Delphi, has most of my property in his hands. And,
if we once get safely to Pharnabazus, we need not trouble
any more about this matter. I must do the Persians the justice
to say that they are always open-handed. And they can
afford to be. It is not too much to say that for one talent
of gold that we have in Greece they have at least a hundred.
Any one who should have the ransacking of one of their
great treasure cities&mdash;and they have others besides Susa;
Babylon, for instance, and Persepolis and Pasargad&aelig;&mdash;would
see something that would astonish them. And&rdquo;&mdash;he added,
with a profound sigh&mdash;&ldquo;if only things had gone straight, I
might have been the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The journey along the northern shore of the Propontis
was accomplished in safety. No Spartan ship had as yet
made its way so far eastward. At a little town on the
Asiatic shore Alcibiades provided his party with horses for
riding and serviceable mules for the conveyance of their
baggage and of such a selection of his own possessions as
he had thought it well to take with him. The old sailor
Hipparchus here wanted to leave them, and to make his
way to Byzantium, where he had relatives. The remainder
Alcibiades addressed before setting out, to the following
effect:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to make our way to Gordium in Phrygia, for it
is there that, if he keeps to his usual habits, we shall find the
Satrap Pharnabazus. He is accustomed to winter there.
But we shall not find it easy to get there. These Bithyn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ians
are not effeminate Asiatics, a hundred of whom will fly
before five stout Greeks. They are Thracians from the
other side of the sea, and we all know how hard are their
heads, and how strong their arms. We cannot force our
way through them; we must elude them if we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The route which the party followed lay for some time
within sight of the sea. This was commonly followed by
travellers, as the mountaineers seldom ventured within the
border of the maritime plain. When they had reached the
head of the Gulf of Olbia they struck inland. The road
usually followed would have taken them by the valley of
Sangarius, a river which divides the great chain of the
Mysian Olympus. Their guide strongly dissuaded them
from taking it. It was constantly watched, he said, by
the mountaineers. No one could hope to escape them, and
only a very strong party could force its way through. The
safest plan would be by certain paths which he knew, and
by which they might hope to cross Olympus unmolested.
Only hunters and shepherds know them, or a chance traveller
on foot for whom it would not be worth the robbers&rsquo;
while to wait. It was a toilsome and even dangerous journey.
The first snows of Autumn had began to fall, and even the
practical eye of the guide found it difficult to discover the
path, while the sufferings of the travellers, who had to
bivouac for several nights in the open air, with but scanty
fire to warm them, were exceedingly severe. Still, but for
one unlucky incident, it would have been accomplished in
safety. The party was now half-way down the southern
slopes of Olympus when they halted for the night at a roadside
inn, or rather caravansary. They found the large re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>ception
chamber&mdash;it contained two only&mdash;already occupied
by a party of the vagrant priests of Cybele. While Alcibiades
and Callias found accommodation, such as it was, in the
smaller room, the rest of the party were thrown upon the
hospitality of the priests, unless indeed, they chose to
bivouac outside. Unluckily, the priests were only too hospitable.
They invited the new comers to an entertainment
which was prolonged into a revel. During the passage of
the mountains the allowances of food had been small, and
for drink the party had had perforce to be satisfied with
the wayside springs or even with melted snow. When
they found themselves under shelter, in a room which was
at least weather-tight, and warmed with a blazing fire,
the sense of contrast tended to relax their powers of self-restraint.
The priests had roasted a couple of sheep, and
broached a cask of the heady wine of Mount Tmolus, with
which a wealthy devotee had presented them. This they
drank, and insisted on their guests drinking, unmixed. By
the time the mutton bones had been picked bare, and the
cask drained to its dregs, not a man out of the twelve was
sober. A heavy slumber, lasting late into the morning, was
the natural consequence of this debauch, and when the
sleepers were at last aroused, they set about the preparation
for a start in a very languid fashion. It was nearly noon before
the party was fairly on its way. Darkness came on before
the next stage could be reached. It was while the
travellers were bivouacking in a wholly unprotected situation
that a company of marauders, who had indeed been watching
their movements for some days in the hopes of finding
such an opportunity, fell upon them. The result was disas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>trous.
Alcibiades and Callias, who had been sleeping with
their horses picketed close to their camp fire, were roused by
the noise, and springing to their saddles made their escape.
Not one of their followers was equally fortunate. Some
were cut down in their sleep, others as they were endeavoring
to collect their senses. The sumpter-horses and their
burdens of course fell into the hands of the assailants. It
was only with what they carried on their own persons that
the two survivors of the party made their way about six
days afterward to the Satrap&rsquo;s winter palace at Gordium.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>ATHENS IN THE DUST.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I feel that my place is at Athens,&rdquo; said Callias to his
host a few days after their arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spite of the past?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. At such a time no one thinks of the past, but only
of the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I cannot say that you are wrong. If you think
fit to go, I shall not seek to hold you back. I must frankly
say that I see little hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Callias went on after a pause. &ldquo;What shall
you do, if I may make so bold as to ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can save my country at all, it will be here. The
only hope now is to detach Persia from Sparta. Perhaps
now that Athens has fallen so low, the Persians will see
what their true interests are. The worst of it is that there is
no real ruler, no one to carry out a consistent policy. The
great king is absolute at the capital, but in the provinces he
is little more than a name. The satraps do almost as they
please; they actually make war on each other if it suits their
purpose. So, it is not what is best for Persia, but what Tissaphernes
or Pharnabazus may think best for himself that
will be done. Still there is a chance left; only I must be on
the spot to seize it if it comes. Were I to go to Athens, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
should be only one man among a useless crowd, and you,
my young friend, will, I very much fear, be little more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow I shall go,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;at all
events there will be one sword more to be drawn for
Athens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; muttered Alcibiades to himself, as his companion
left the room, &ldquo;if you get the chance of drawing it. I
rather think that with that fox Lysander in command,
you will do nothing more for Athens than bring one more
mouth to be fed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias made his way to the coast with no difficulty. Assuming,
at the suggestion of Alcibiades, a citizen&rsquo;s dress, he
joined a caravan of traders which was on its way westward,
and in their company travelled pleasantly and safely. Arrived
at Miletus he took passage in a merchant ship that
was bound for &AElig;gina, hoping if he could only get so far, to
be able to make his way somehow into the city. At one
time, indeed, he was terribly afraid that this hope would be
disappointed. The <i>Swallow</i>&mdash;this was the name of the vessel
of &AElig;gina&mdash;was challenged and overhauled by a Corinthian
ship of war. Callias made no attempt to conceal his
nationality. Indeed it would have been useless, for an
Athenian in those days was about as easily recognized over
the whole of the Greek world as an Englishman is recognized
in these, anywhere in Europe. To his great surprise
the Corinthian captain simply said: &ldquo;You can go; I have
no order to detain you.&rdquo; That there was no kindness in
his permission Callias was perfectly well aware, for the
hatred of Corinth for Athens was tenfold more bitter than
that of Sparta.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a quarrel between Athens and Corinth, on the
tender point of a rebellious Corinthian colony, that had been
the immediate cause of the Peloponnesian War; and even
before this there had always been the potent influence of
commercial rivalry to set the two states against each other.
The young Athenian noticed also a sinister smile on the captain&rsquo;s
face; but what it meant he was at a loss to determine.</p>

<p>Landed at &AElig;gina he lost no time in enquiring how he
might best reach his destination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you will get in easily enough,&rdquo; said the &AElig;ginetan
merchant, the owner of the <i>Swallow</i>, to whom he stated
his case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not the city blockaded then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a way,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please to explain what you mean,&rdquo; said Callias, who
was getting a little heated by these mysterious remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;King Pausanias is encamped
outside the city in some place that they call the Grove of
Academus, I think. Do you know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias assented with a nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Lysander has a hundred and fifty ships off the
Piraeus. Still I think that you will be able to get in. The
blockade is not kept very strictly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I best go by night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you help me to a boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but you will have to pay the boatman pretty
highly, for, of course, it is a risk, though it can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you make the arrangements if I pay you the money
in advance?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you do not mind going so far as a <i>mina</i>. It
is really worth the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias paid the money, and was told to be in readiness to
embark at midnight.</p>

<p>It would have enlightened him considerably if he could
have seen the merchant&rsquo;s behavior as soon as he was safely
out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you young serpent,&rdquo; the man cried, &ldquo;you will be allowed
to creep into your hole easily enough; but if we don&rsquo;t
suffocate you and your whole brood when we have got you
there, my name is not Timagenes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact was that a revolution of which Callias knew
nothing had taken place at &AElig;gina. An old rival and enemy
of Athens, the city had been conquered many years before,
and the anti-Athenian party expelled. And now everything
was changed. Lysander had brought back the exiles,
and though Athens had still friends, it was the hostile
party that was in power. Callias had observed a certain
change in the demeanor of the people, but was too much
engrossed in his own affairs to think much about it.</p>

<p>The blockade was run as easily as the &AElig;ginetan had foretold.
The boat passed within fifty yards of one of the
squadron, and Callias could have sworn that he saw a
sentinel on the watch pacing the vessel&rsquo;s deck. But the
man did not challenge, and the Piraeus was reached without
any difficulty.</p>

<p>It was not long before all the mystery was explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is just what I feared,&rdquo; said Hippocles, to whose
house the young Athenian hastened. &ldquo;I knew that you
would come back, and I could not warn you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; cried the young man in astonishment.
&ldquo;Was it not my duty to return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in one way it was. But tell me how you got here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias related the incidents of his journey, and expressed
some surprise that the Corinthian captain had not taken
him prisoner, and that the blockade was so negligently
kept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you did not understand what all this meant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I understood nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;it simply means
that Lysander is going to starve us out, and that the more
there are of us the easier and the speedier his work will be.
This has been his policy all along. He has taken no prisoners.
Whenever he has taken a city, and there is hardly one
that has not either been taken or given itself up, he has sent
every Athenian citizen home. They are simply put
on their parole to come here. The consequence is that the
city is fairly swarming with people, and that there is next
to no food. I have a good store&mdash;for some time past I have
kept myself well provisioned, not knowing what might
happen&mdash;and I am able to do something for my poor neighbors.
But the state of things in the city is simply awful.
People, and people too whom I know as really well-to-do
citizens, are dying of sheer starvation. As for the poor
women and children it is truly heart breaking. Oh, my
dear friend, if you had only stopped away; for here you can
do nothing. But I knew you would come back, and I honor
you for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can nothing be done?&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;It
is better to die than be starved like a wolf in his den.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people have lost all heart. And indeed, if they
were all brave as lions, we are hopelessly outnumbered.
Pausanias must have as many as forty thousand men outside
the city, for every city in the Island<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> except Argos,
has sent its contingent; and we could not muster a fourth
part of the number, and such troops too! And where is
our fleet? At the bottom of the &AElig;gean, or in the arsenals
of the enemy. I do not suppose that there are fifty ships,
all told, in our docks. And of these a third are not sea-worthy.
No, we must submit; and yet it is almost as much
as a man&rsquo;s life is worth to mention the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But could we not make terms of some kind, not good
terms I fear, but still such as would be endurable? Has
anything been done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Senate sent to Agis, who was at Deccleia,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and proposed
peace on these terms: Athens was to become the ally
of Sparta on the condition of having the same friends and the
same enemies, but was to be allowed to keep the Long
Walls<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and the Piraeus. Agis said that he had no authority
to treat, and bade the envoys go to Sparta. So they came
back here, and were directed to go. They reached a place
on the borders of Laconia and sent on their message to the
ephors at Sparta, not being allowed to proceed any further
themselves. The ephors sent back this answer: &lsquo;Begone
instantly; if the Athenians really desire peace, let them
send you again with other proposals, such as having re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>flected
more wisely they may be disposed to make.&rsquo; So
the envoys returned. Some had hoped that they would do
some good. I must confess that I had not. There was
terrible dismay. At last one Archistratus plucked up
courage to speak. &lsquo;The Lacedaemonians can force us to
accept what conditions they please. Let us acknowledge
what we cannot deny, and make peace with them on their
own terms.&rsquo; There was a howl of rage at this, for in truth
the Lacedaemonian terms were nothing less than this:
&lsquo;Pull down a mile of the Long Walls, and give up your
fleet.&rsquo; The unlucky Archistratus was thrown into prison
where he lies still. Well, one said one thing, one another.
At last Theramenes got up and said: &lsquo;The real manager of
affairs is neither Agis nor Pausanias, nor even the Ephors,
but Lysander. Send me to him&mdash;he is a personal friend of
mine own&mdash;and I will make the best terms I can with him.&rsquo;
To this the assembly agreed, having indeed nothing better
to do. That was three or four days ago. Theramenes
started the same night. I very much doubt whether
he will be able to do any good. I am not even sure that he
means to. But we shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A miserable period of waiting followed. Day after day
passed, and the envoy neither returned nor sent any communication
to his fellow countrymen. No one knew where
he was. Whether he was still with Lysander or had gone
on to Sparta&mdash;all was a mystery. Meanwhile the distress in
the city grew more and more acute. Callias had taken up
his abode with Hippocles, and was so out of absolute want.
He was perfectly ready to acquiesce in the extreme frugality
which was the rule of the house. Free and bond all fared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
alike, and none had anything beyond the most absolute
necessaries of life. Whatever could be spared was devoted
to the relief of the needy.</p>

<p>Not the least trying part of the situation was the forced
inaction. Not even a sally was made. Indeed, it would
have been a useless waste of life. Not only were the forces
of the enemy vastly superior, but the besieged soldiers were
almost unable to support the weight of their arms, so scanty
was the fare to which they were reduced. There were
times when Callias was disposed to rush sword in hand on
some outpost of the enemy, sell his life as dearly as he could,
and perish.</p>

<p>Two things held him back from carrying this idea into
execution, things curiously unlike, yet working together
for the same result. One was his love for Hermione. Life
had not lost all its charm, his horizon was not wholly dark,
while there remained the light of this hope. Indeed it was
the one consolation of his life that he was permitted to help
her in her daily ministration among her needy neighbors.
A string of pensioners presented themselves at the
merchant&rsquo;s gates, and received such relief as he could give.
But Hermione was not content with this. There were some,
she knew, whose pride would not permit them to mingle in
the train of mendicants; there were others whose strength
did not permit them to come abroad. These she sought out
in their own homes. Callias found a melancholy pleasure
in accompanying and helping her. Not a word of love
passed his lips. He would have scorned himself if he had
added the smallest grain to the burden of care that she bore.
But he never failed in his attendance, and he was hailed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
many a poor sufferer with a pleasure only second to that
which greeted the gracious presence of the girl. When, as
happened before long, fever the unfailing follower of
famine, began to spread its ravages over the Piraeus, his
labors and hers grew more arduous. Battling with these
two fearful enemies within the walls, Callias almost forgot
the foes that were without.</p>

<p>The other restraining and strengthening influence was
that which Socrates exercised on the young man&rsquo;s mind.
All the time that Callias could spare from the labors that he
shared with Hermione was given to the society of the philosopher.
The sage&rsquo;s indomitable courage and endurance
were in themselves an encouragement of the highest order.
Doubtless his physical strength, which made him capable of
bearing an almost incredible degree of cold and hunger,
helped him to show a dauntless heart to the troubles which
were breaking down so many. Indeed he seemed scarcely
to want food or drink. But the steadfastness with
which he pursued his usual course of life, still keeping up
his untiring search for wisdom was a spectacle nothing less
than splendid, while nothing could exceed his practical sagacity.
Anyone who wanted shrewd advice in the actual
circumstances of life, anyone who desired to be lifted out of
the sordid present, with its miserable hopes and cares, on to
a higher plane of life, came to Socrates and did not come in
vain.</p>

<p>At length, when nearly three months had passed, the
long period of suspense seemed about to come to an end.
The report ran through the city that Theramenes had returned.
What were the terms he had brought back, no one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
knew. On that point he remained obstinately silent. In
fact he had nothing to say, nothing further, that is, than
the fact that Lysander professed himself unable to treat;
the Ephors must be approached, if anything was to be
done.</p>

<p>Had Lysander amused him with hopes that instructions
and power to treat would soon be sent down to him from
Sparta, or had he deliberately waited till the city should
be reduced to such a pitch of starvation that it would be
ready to consent to any terms? There was a brutal, cold-blooded
cruelty in such conduct that makes it difficult to
credit; yet many believed it to be the true explanation of
the delay.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> To picture the dismay that prevailed through
the assembly when Theramenes had given his report of the
negotiations which he had <i>not</i> concluded would be impossible.
There was nothing to be done but accept the bitter necessity.
Theramenes, with nine others, was sent to Sparta
with full power to treat. They were to accept any terms
that might be offered. The proud city had fallen as low as
that.</p>

<p>Then came another time of waiting. Happily it was not
long. Theramenes felt that the endurance of his countrymen
had been tried to the uttermost, and that nothing more
was to be gained. Athens was on her knees. It did not
suit him and his purposes&mdash;for he had purposes of his own,
possibly a tyranny, certainly power&mdash;that she should be
actually prostrate. He and his colleagues made all the
haste that they could; and as their instructions were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
simple&mdash;to accept anything that might be offered&mdash;there
was little to delay them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<span class="caption">THE PARTHENON AT THE PRESENT DAY.</span>
</div>

<p>At the end of about twelve days they returned. It was
in the midst of a breathless suspense that Theramenes stood
up to make his report. What he said may be thus given in
outline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went with all speed to Sellasia<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and there waited,
having sent on a message to the Ephors that we had come
with full power to treat. On the second day we were summoned
to Sparta. There we found envoys assembled from
the allies of the Lacedaemonians. Aristides also was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the mention of the name of Aristides a murmur of fear
and rage ran through the assembly. The man was one of
the most notorious of the anti-patriotic party. He had
been in exile for many years, and was believed to have done
more harm than any one else to his native city.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The senior of the Ephors stood up, and said: &lsquo;Friends
and allies, the Athenians seek for peace. What say you?
Shall we grant it to them?&rsquo; One after another the envoys
rose in their places. They did not use many words. It was
not the custom of the place to be long in speech as they
knew. All said the same thing. &lsquo;We give our vote against
peace. Let Athens be destroyed. There will be no true
peace so long as she is permitted to exist.&rsquo; When all had
spoken we were called on to speak. &lsquo;You hear what these
say,&rsquo; said the Ephor who had not spoken before. &lsquo;What
have you to reply?&rsquo; I answered that the Athenians were
ready to give all pledges that might be asked from them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
that they would not harm either Sparta or her allies
or any city of the Greeks. After this we were all commanded
to withdraw. In about the space of an hour we
were summoned again into the chamber. The Ephor rose
in his place and spoke. &lsquo;The Corinthians and the other
allies demand that Athens should be destroyed. Nor do
they this without reason. The Athenians have destroyed
many cities of the Greeks. Yet can we not forget that they
have also in time past done good service to Greece. But of
these things which you all know it is needless to speak. Our
sentence is this: Let the Athenians pull down their Long
Walls for the space of a mile. Let them also surrender
their fleet, keeping only twelve ships. On these terms they
shall have peace. These then, O men of Athens,&rsquo; the speaker
continued, &lsquo;are the conditions which the Spartans demand.
I confess that they are hard. Yet they are better
than those which the rest of Greece would impose upon you.
Truly the Lacedaemonians stand between us and utter destruction.
And there is nothing beyond remedy in what
they would lay upon us. Walls that are broken down may
be repaired, and for ships that have been given up many
others may be built; but of a city against which the decree
of destruction has gone forth, there is an end. Therefore I
propose that peace be made with the Lacedaemonians on
these terms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One or two speakers ventured to rise in opposition. But
they could scarcely get a hearing. Probably they only
went through the form of opposing in order that they might
be able at some future time to say that they had done so.
With but short delay the proposition was put to the vote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
and carried by an overwhelming majority. The same evening
envoys were sent to Lysander announcing that the
Spartan conditions had been accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day the gates of the city were thrown open, and
the fleet of Lysander sailed into the Piraeus. The ships of
war were handed over to him. Many were destroyed, and
indeed the once famous and powerful fleet of Atticus had
been reduced to a state of most deplorable weakness. The
sacrifice of the fleet, such as it was, was not so very costly
after all. The few sea-worthy ships that remained, besides
the twelve that the city was permitted to retain, were sent off
to the Lacedaemonian arsenal of Gytheum. This done,
the next thing was to beat down the Long Walls. &lsquo;This
is the first day of the freedom of Greece,&rsquo; said Lysander,
&lsquo;we must keep it as a festival. Send for the flute players.&rsquo;
Accordingly the services of every flute player in Attica
were requisitioned; and to the sound of the gayest tunes
which they could find in their <i>repertoire</i> the work of demolition
went on. Every decent Athenian whatever his
policy, kept, of course, close within doors; but there was
nevertheless a vast concourse of spectators, the rabble who
will crowd to any sight, however brutal and humiliating,
the army of Pausanias and the crews of Lysander&rsquo;s fleet,
with a miscellaneous crowd of foreigners who had come to
gloat over the downfall of the haughty city. Loud was the
shout that went up when a clean breach was made through
the walls. The general feeling was that Athens had suffered
a blow from which she could never recover. But
there were some who doubted. &lsquo;You have scratched the
snake, not killed it,&rsquo; said a Corinthian, as he turned away.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>&ldquo;NOBLESSE OBLIGE.&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>Some fourteen or fifteen days have passed since the humiliation
of Athens was completed. To have come to the
end, bitter as it was, was in one way a relief. To know the
worst always brings a certain comfort, and that worst
might have been, was, in fact, very near being far more
terrible than what actually happened. Then there was a
great material relief. The pressure of famine was removed.
Supplies poured plentifully into Athens, for the city, in spite
of all its sacrifices and losses, was still rich. If fever still
remained&mdash;it always lingers a while after its precursor,
hunger, has departed&mdash;it was now possible to cope with it
effectually. And then, last not least, it was the delightful
season of spring. The Athenians could once more enjoy the
delights of that country life from which they had been shut
out so long, but which they had never ceased to love.
Attica, indeed, had suffered sadly from the presence, repeated
year after year, of the invading host; but it had suffered
less than might have been expected. The olive yards in particular,
had not been touched. A religious feeling had forbidden
any injury to a tree which was supposed to be under the
special protection of the patron goddess of the land. The
sacred groves also of the heroes, that were scattered about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the country, had not been harmed. Not a few houses with
their gardens had been saved by having served as residences
for officers high in command in the Peloponnesian army.
And now Nature, the restorer, was busy in the genial season
of growth in healing or at least hiding the wounds that
had been made by the ravages of war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to a trip to Marathon?&rdquo; said Hippocles
one day, to his daughter and Callias. &ldquo;You both of
you look as if a little fresh air would do you good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea,&rdquo; cried Hermione, clapping her hands,
&ldquo;it is years since I have seen the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you, Callias?&rdquo; said Hippocles, turning to the
young man.</p>

<p>Callias was only too glad to join any expedition when he
was to have the company of Hermione. He did not give
this reason, but he assented to the proposal very heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, father, how shall we go?&rdquo; said Hermione. &ldquo;There
is scarcely a horse to be found, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not go by sea?&rdquo; was her father&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I have
a pinnace which would just suit us. We will go to-morrow
if the weather holds fine, stop the first night at Sunium,
and the second at Marathon. At Sunium there is my villa,
and at Marathon there is a little house of which I can get
the use, and which will serve us if we do not mind roughing
it a little. We can return the next day. Only we must
take provisions, for except such fish as we may catch in the
Marathon stream, and possibly, some goats&rsquo; milk, if
all the goats have not been eaten up, we shall have
nothing but what we bring. That must be your care,
Hermione.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust me, father,&rdquo; cried the girl joyously. &ldquo;If you
have gone through four months&rsquo; famine, depend upon it
you shall not be starved now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weather on the following day was all that could be
desired. A warm and gentle west wind was blowing.
This served them very well as they sailed southward to
Sunium. In such good time did they reach the promontory,
that by unanimous vote they agreed to finish their
journey that same day. Sailing northward was as easy
as sailing southward, and the sun was still an hour
from setting when they reached the northern end of the
plain, having travelled a distance of upwards of sixty miles.
This was about four times as far as they would have had to
go, had they made the journey by land. No one, however,
regretted having followed Hippocles&rsquo; suggestion. The
voyage was indeed as delightful an excursion as could have
been devised. The deep blue sky overhead, the sea, borrowing
from the heavens a color as intense, and only touched
here and there with a speck of white where a little wave
swelled and broke, sea birds now flying high in the air, now
darting for their prey into the waters, the white cliffs
tipped with the fresh green of spring that framed the coast
line, made a picture that the party intensely enjoyed, although
they did not put their enjoyment into words with
the fluency and ease which would have come readily to a
modern. The ancients loved nature, but, as a rule, they felt
this love much more than they expressed it.</p>

<p>The little house at Marathon was one that had escaped
destruction by having been occupied by a Spartan
officer. It was bare indeed of furniture, but it was habitable;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and the party had brought with them the few things
that were absolutely necessary, far fewer, we must remember,
than what we now consider to be indispensable. Supper
was felt by all to be a most enjoyable meal. The room in
which they sat was bare, for, of course, the luxurious
couches on which it was the fashion to recline were absent.
There was not even a table, and there was but one
broken chair, which was naturally resigned to Hermione.
But it was lightened with a cheerful fire, which was not unwelcome
after seven or eight hours&rsquo; exposure to a high wind.
Happily the late occupant had left a store of logs, which had
been cut on the slopes of Pentelicus in the previous autumn,
and which now blazed up most cheerfully. The meal was declared
by both Hippocles and Callias to be good enough for
a State-banquet in the Prytaneum. One of the sailors had
caught a basketful of fish in the stream, and these Hermione
had cooked with her own hands. An Athenian who
had plenty of fish, seldom wanted anything in the
way of flesh, and the provisions which Hermione, not
liking to trust to the skill or the luck of the anglers had
brought with her, were not touched. A cold maize pudding,
some of the famous Attic figs, which had been preserved
through the winter, bread with honey from Hymettus, and
dried grapes completed the repast. Some of the goats, it
turned out, had survived, and a jug of their milk was forthcoming
for Hermione. The two men had a flask of wine
which they largely diluted with water. When, after the
libation, Hippocles proposed the toast of the evening, as, in
consideration of the locality it might fairly be called, &ldquo;To
the memory of the Heroes of Marathon,&rdquo; Hermione honored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
it by putting her lips to the cup. It was the first time
that wine had ever passed them, but she could not
refuse this tribute to the chief glory of the city of her
adoption.</p>

<p>Hermione, fatigued, it may be said, with all the delights
of the day, retired early to rest. Soon after she had gone
Callias took the opportunity of opening his heart to his companion
on a subject which had long occupied his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have peace at last,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not such a peace as I
had ever hoped for, but still better than the utter ruin
which lately I had begun to fear. A good citizen may now
begin to think of himself and of his own happiness. You,
sir, can hardly have failed to observe why I have begun to
look for that happiness. If your daughter will only consent
to share my life, I feel that I shall have to ask the gods for
nothing more. She is free as far as I know. And me you
have known from my childhood. You were my father&rsquo;s
friend and since he died you have stood in his place. Can
you give her to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hippocles caught his young companion&rsquo;s hand, and gave
it a hearty grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not pretend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not to have observed
something of what you say; nor will I deny that I have observed
it with pleasure. What father would not be glad if
Callias, the son of Hipponicus, loved his daughter? Of Hermione&rsquo;s
feelings I say nothing, indeed I know nothing, save
that she has regarded you since childhood with a strong affection,
and that as you say she is free. But there are facts
which neither you nor I can forget; and the chief of them is
this, that while you are Callias, son of Hipponicus, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Eupatrid of the Eupatrids,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I am Hippocles, the Alien. I
am well-born in my own country, but that is nothing here.
I am wealthy&mdash;so wealthy that I care not a single drachma
whether my future son-in-law has a thousand talents for his
patrimony or one. I am, I hope and believe, not without
honor in the city of my adoption. But I am an alien, my
child is an alien. Whether you have thought of all that
this means I know not&mdash;love is apt to hide these difficulties
from a man&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;but the fact must be faced; you and
my daughter must face it. You speak of my giving her to
you. But, if Hermione is a Greek, she is also an Italian.
The Italian women choose for themselves. I could not if
I would constrain her will. She must decide, and she must
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that I should desire better. But you
do not tell me, sir, what you yourself wish. Have I your
consent and your good wishes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hippocles, &ldquo;you have. I have thought over
the difficulties, for I foresaw that you would some day
speak to me on this subject. As far as I am concerned I am
ready to waive them. But then, they do not concern me
in the first place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men sat in silence for some time after this
conversation had passed between them, buried each of
them in his own thoughts. At last Hippocles rose from his
seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time to sleep,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will speak to my daughter
to-morrow; you shall not want my good word, but I can
do nothing more. You must speak to her yourself. That<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
is, I think, what few fathers in Greece would tell a suitor to
do. But then Hermione is not as other maidens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias passed a restless night, and was glad, to make
his way into the open air when the first streaks of dawn appeared
on the Eub&#339;an hills, which were in full view from
the house. He shrank from meeting Hermione till he could
meet her alone, and ask the momentous question which was
occupying his whole mind. Partly to employ the time,
partly to banish thought, if it might be done by severe
bodily exercise, he started to climb the height of Pentelicus,
which rose on the southern side of the Marathonian plain.
The excursion occupied him the whole morning. On his
way back he traversed the hills which skirted the western
side of the plain, and, following what was evidently a well-beaten
track, came at last in view of the mound under
which reposed the Athenian dead who had fallen in that
great battle. His quick eye soon perceived a familiar figure,
conspicuous in its white garments among the monuments
which stood on the top of the mound. Hippocles had fulfilled
his promise, and had said all that he could to Hermione
in favor of her suitor. He had dwelt upon his noble
birth, the reputation as a soldier which he had already won,
his culture and taste for philosophy, and his blameless life.
&ldquo;As for wealth,&rdquo; he ended by saying, &ldquo;that is of little account
where my daughter is concerned. Yet a man should
be independent of his wife, and I may tell you as one who
knows&mdash;and I have had charge of his property for some
years past&mdash;that Callias is one of the richest men in Athens.
That will not weigh with you I know, but I would have
you know all the circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hermione said nothing; she took her father&rsquo;s hand and
kissed it. A tear dropped on it as she raised it to her lips.
As she turned away, Hippocles noticed that she was shaken
by a sob.</p>

<p>An instinct in the girl&rsquo;s heart told her that it was on the
mound that her lover would speak to her, and it was here
that she wished to give her answer to him. It was not the
first time that she had visited it. Indeed there was not a
woman, and not many men in Athens who knew so much
about its records.</p>

<p>On the top of this tumulus, which still rises thirty feet
above the surrounding plain, and which was then, it is
probable, considerably higher, there stood in those days
eleven stone columns inscribed with the names of those who
had fallen in the great battle. Each of the ten Athenian
tribes had its own peculiar column, while the eleventh commemorated
the gallant men of Plataea, Plataea, which
alone among the cities of Greece, had sent her sons on that
day to stand shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers of
Athens.</p>

<p>Hermione was apparently engrossed in the task of deciphering
the names, now grown somewhat obliterated by
time, which were engraved on one of the columns. So intent
was she on this occupation that she did not notice the
young man&rsquo;s approach. Turning suddenly round, she
faced him. At that moment, though she had expected him
to come, his actual coming was a surprise, and the hot blood
crimsoned her face and neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hermione,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have spoken to your father, and
he bids me speak to you. You can hardly have failed to read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
my heart, and if I have not spoken to you before, it has been
because I have not presumed. You know all that needs be
known about me, and though I do not think myself worthy
of you, I need not be ashamed of my fathers or of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brilliant color had faded from the girl&rsquo;s cheek, her
hand trembled, her bosom heaved. Twice she opened her
lips; twice the voice seemed to fail her. At last she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak of your fathers. You are, I think, of the
tribe of Pandion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is the column of their tribe, and this&rdquo;&mdash;she
pointed as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;the name of an ancestor of yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;this Hipponicus whose
name you see engraved here was my great grandfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had been Archon at Athens the year before the
great battle. You see,&rdquo; she added with a faint smile, &ldquo;I
know something of your family history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his son, a Callias like yourself, was Archon general
many times&mdash;held, in fact, every honor that Athens
could bestow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was no more distinguished man in the city
than he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your father; he died, I think I have heard, in early
manhood; but he was already far advanced in the career of
honor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubtless had he lived he would not have been inferior
in distinction to my grandfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have started well in the same course? I need
not ask you that. We all know it better, perhaps, than you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
know it yourself, and we are proud of it. My dear brother,&rdquo;
the girl&rsquo;s voice which hitherto had been clear and even
commanding in its tones, faltered at the mention of the
dead, &ldquo;my dear brother used to say that there was
nothing that you might not hope for, nothing to which you
might not rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak too well of me; but I hope that I am not altogether
unworthy of my ancestors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl paused for a while. She seemed unable to utter
what she had next to say. The flush mounted again to her
cheek, and she stood silent and with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young man stood in utter perplexity. He
had heard nothing from the girl&rsquo;s lips but what might
have made any man proud to hear. She knew, as she had
said, the history of his race, and she believed him to be not
unworthy of it. Yet this was not the way in which he had
hoped to hear her speak. He was conscious that there was
something behind that did not promise well for his hopes.</p>

<p>At last she went on. Her voice was low but distinct, her
eyes were still bent on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what your fathers have been in Athens, what you
hope to be yourself, you would have your son to be after
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he answered without thinking of what he was
admitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be so if I&mdash;&rdquo; she altered the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;if a
woman not of Athenian blood were his mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was struck dumb. So this was the end she had before
her when she enumerated the honors and distinctions of his
race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not say that my race is unworthy
of yours. I am not ashamed of my ancestors. They were
chiefs; they were good men. I am proud to be their daughter.
But here in Athens their goodness and their nobility goes
for nothing. I am Hermione, the daughter of Hippocles,
the Alien. Marrying me you shut out, not perhaps yourself,
but your children from the career which is their inheritance.
I am too proud,&rdquo;&mdash;and here the girl dropped
her voice to a whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;and I love you too well for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is my career to your love?&rdquo; cried the young man
passionately; &ldquo;I am ready to give up country and all for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Hermione, &ldquo;is the only unworthy thing
that I ever heard you say. Your better thoughts will make
you withdraw it. Athens has fallen; the gods know that
it has wrung my heart to see it. But she needs all the more
such sons as you are. She has little now to offer. It is a
thankless office, perhaps, to command her fleets and armies.
All the more honor to those who cling to her still and cherish
her still. You must not leave her or betray her. I
should think foul shame of myself if I tempted you for a
moment to waver in your loyalty to her. I may not love
you&mdash;that the gods have forbidden me&mdash;but you will let me
be proud of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man turned away. The final word, he knew,
had been spoken. This resolution was not to be shaken by
indignant reproaches or by tender pleadings. All that remained
was to forget, if that was possible. He would not
see Hippocles or his daughter again till the wound of this
bitter disappointment had had time to heal. Returning to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the house, which he found empty but for a single attendant,
he snatched a hasty meal, and then set out to return over-land
to Athens.</p>

<small>THE END OF ALCIBIADES.</small></h2>


<p>Three days after the events recorded in the last chapter&mdash;it
took so much time for the young man to screw up his
courage to the point&mdash;Callias made his way to the ship-yard
of Hippocles at an hour when he knew that he would be
pretty certain to find the master there. He was not disappointed,
nor could he help being touched by the warm sympathy
with which he was received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear friend,&rdquo; cried the merchant, &ldquo;this has
been a great disappointment to me. I must own that I had
my fears. I know something, you see, of my daughter&rsquo;s
temper. I knew that she had always chafed under our
disabilities. Things that have ceased to trouble me&mdash;and I
must own that they never troubled me much&mdash;are grievous
to her. You see that I have a power of my own which is
quite enough to satisfy any reasonable man. I can&rsquo;t speak
or vote in your assembly, but I have a voice, if I choose to
use it, in your policy. She knows very little about this, and
would not appreciate it if she did. Besides it would not
avail her. No; she feels herself an inferior here, and it galls
her; yet that is scarcely the way to put it, for she was thinking
much more of you than of herself. I believe that she loves
you&mdash;she has not confided in me, you must understand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
but I guess as much&mdash;and she would sooner cut off her
right hand than injure you or yours. And then her pride
comes in also. &lsquo;Am I, daughter of kings as I am,&rsquo; she
says to herself, &lsquo;am I to be one to bring humiliation into
an ancient house?&rsquo; Her mother&rsquo;s forefathers would be
called barbarians here, but they were kings and heroes for
all that. And that is the bitterness of it to her: to feel herself
your equal in birth, and yet to know that to marry you
would be to drag you down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;it is noble; but just now
my heart rebels very loudly against it. Let us say no more.
I have come to ask you what you would advise. For the
present I cannot stay at Athens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Hippocles, &ldquo;is exactly what I wanted to
talk to you about; if you had not come to-day I should have
sought for you. You wish to leave Athens, you say. It is
well, for it would not be safe for you to stay. We shall have
a bad time in Athens for the next few months, perhaps for
longer. The exiles have come back full of rage and thirsting
for revenge. And then there is Theramenes; he is the man
you have to fear. He has the murder of the generals on his
soul. That, perhaps, would not trouble him much but he
fears all who might be disposed to call him to account for it.
He knows that you were the kinsman and dear friend of
Diomedon, and he will take the first opportunity that may
occur of doing you a mischief. And opportunities will not
be wanting. I suspect that for some time to come, with the
Oligarchs in power and the Lacedaemonians to back them
up, laws and constitutional forms will not go for much in
Athens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you advise me to go?&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly there is nothing to keep you. For the present
there is no career for you here. I don&rsquo;t despair of Athens;
but for some time to come she will have a very humble part
to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to suggest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking over it for two or three days.
Many things have occurred to me, but nothing so good as
was suggested by a letter which I received this morning.
It came from a merchant in Rhodes with whom I have had
dealings for some years past. My correspondent asks for a
large advance in money for a commercial speculation which
he says promises large profits. I have always found the
man honest; in fact the outcomes of my dealings with him
in the past have been quite satisfactory. But this new
venture that he proposes is a very large one indeed. I like
what he tells me of it. It opens up quite a new field of
enterprise; and new fields, I need hardly tell you, have a
great charm for a man in my position. The ordinary routine
of commerce does not interest me very much; but
something new is very attractive. Now I want you to go
to Rhodes for me. Make all the enquiries you can about
the character and standing of my correspondent, whom,
curiously enough, I have never seen. I will give you introductions
to those who will put you in the way of
hearing all that is to be heard. If the man&rsquo;s credit
is shaky at all, then I shall know that this proposition
of his is a desperate venture. If all is sound, I shall feel
pretty sure that he has got hold of a really good
thing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very little of such matters,&rdquo; said the young Callias
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not ask you to go that you may judge of this particular
enterprise; I simply want you to find out what people
are saying about Diagoras&mdash;that is my correspondent&rsquo;s
name; you will be simply an Athenian gentleman on his
travels. Keep your ears open and you will be sure to hear
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;I will do my best; but don&rsquo;t expect
too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you start to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you think it necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my affair is not urgent for some days, at least.
But for yourself, I fancy you cannot get out of the way too
soon. I don&rsquo;t think that Theramenes and his friends will
stick much at forms and ceremonies. I own that I shall
feel much happier when there are two or three hundred
miles of sea between you and them. Be here an hour after
sunset to-morrow. By that time I shall have arranged for
your passage and got ready your letters of introduction and
the rest of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young man to himself as he went to
make his preparations for departure, &ldquo;this, it must be confessed,
is a little hard on me. Hermione says, &lsquo;Stop in
Athens and stick to your career&rsquo;; her father says, &lsquo;If you stop
in Athens you are as good as a dead man, and your career will
be cut short by the hemlock cup.&rsquo; I have to give up my
love for my career and then give up my career for my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is needless to relate the incidents of my hero&rsquo;s voyage
to Rhodes or of his stay on that island. His special mission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
he was able to accomplish easily enough. Diagoras&rsquo; speculation
was, as he soon found out, the last resource of an embarrassed
man; and the loan for which he asked would be a
risk too great for any prudent person to undertake. The letter
in which he communicated what he had heard to Hippocles
was crossed by one from Athens. From this he learned that
the political anticipations of the merchant had been more
than fulfilled. The oligarchical revolution had been carried
on with the most outrageous violence. On the very day on
which he had left Athens, an officer of the government had
come with an order for his arrest.</p>

<p>All this was interesting; still more so was a brief communication
from Alcibiades which the merchant enclosed.
It ran thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alcibiades to Callias son of Hipponicus, greeting. Great
things are possible now to the bold of whom I know you to
be one. More I do not say, but come to me as soon as you
can. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant had added a postscript. &ldquo;I leave this for
your consideration. Alcibiades has a certain knack of success.
But the risk will be great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is risk to me?&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spend my
life idling here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day he left the island, taking his passage in a
merchant ship which, by great good luck was just starting
for Smyrna. Smyrna was reached without any mishap.
Four days afterwards, he started with a guide for the little
village in Phrygia from which Alcibiades had dated his
note. Halting at noon on the first day&rsquo;s journey to rest
their horses, they were accosted by a miserable looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
wayfarer, who begged for some scraps of food, declaring
that he had not broken his fast for four and twenty hours.
Something in the man&rsquo;s voice and face struck Callias as familiar,
and he puzzled in vain for a solution of the
mystery, while the stranger sat eagerly devouring the meal
with which he had been furnished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Callias, when the man had finished his repast
and was thanking him, &ldquo;here is something to help you
along till you can find friends or employment.&rdquo; And he
gave him four or five silver pieces.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken in the fugitive&rsquo;s hearing,
and the man, who, now that his ravenous hunger was
appeased, had leisure to notice other things, started at the
sound of his voice. He, on his part, seemed to recognize
something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many thanks, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the gods pay you back
ten-fold. But surely,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I have seen you before.
Ah! now I remember. You are Callias the son of
Hipponicus, and you were my master&rsquo;s guest in Thrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light flashed on the young Athenian&rsquo;s mind. The man
had been one of Alcibiades&rsquo; attendants in his Thracian castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I remember,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and your master was Alcibiades.
But what do you here? How does he fare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man burst into tears. &ldquo;Ah, sir, he is dead, cruelly
killed by those villains of Spartans. He was the very best
of masters. I never had a rough word from him. We all
loved him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;how it happened. I was on my
way to him,&rdquo; and he read to the man the brief note that had
been forwarded to him at Rhodes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand. I know when that was written. He
had great hopes of being able to do something. I did not
rightly understand what it was, but the common talk
among us who were of his household was that he was going
to the Great King to persuade him that the best thing that
he could do would be to set Athens on her feet again to help
him against Sparta. Oh! he was a wonderful man to persuade,
was my master. Nobody could help being taken by
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me the story,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it happened in this way. My master had gone up
to see Pharnabazus, the Satrap, who had promised to aid
him on his way up to Susa to see the Great King. There
were six of us with him; his secretary, myself and four
slaves. There was Timandra, also, whom he used to call
his wife; but his real wife was an Athenian lady, Hipparete,
I have heard say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Callias, &ldquo;I knew her; a cousin of my
own; a most unhappy marriage. But go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Pharnabazus received him most hospitably.
There was no good house in the village, so we had three
cottages. Alcibiades had one; the secretary and I another,
and the slaves, a third. Every day the satrap sent a handsome
supply of provisions for us; dishes and wine from his
own table for my master, and for us all that we could want
for ourselves. I never fared better in my life. And my
master had long talks with him and seemed in excellent
spirits. Everything was going on as well as possible. Then
there came a change. I never could find out whether my
master had heard anything to make him suspicious. If he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
had, he certainly told the secretary nothing about it. But
he was very much depressed. First he sent Timandra away.
She was very unwilling to go, poor lady, for she did love
my master very much, though, as I say, she was not really
his wife. But my master insisted on it, so she went away
to stay with some friends. After that his spirits grew worse
and worse. He used to tell his secretary the dreams he
had. Once he dreamt he was dressed in Timandra&rsquo;s
clothes, and that she was putting rouge and powder on his
face. At another time he seemed to see himself laid on a
funeral pyre and the people standing round ready to set it
on fire. The very night after he had that dream
we were awakened by a tremendous uproar; the
secretary and I got up and looked out. The master&rsquo;s
cottage, which was about a stadium<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> away from ours
was on fire, and there were a number of Persians, about
fifty or sixty, standing round it, shouting out and cursing
him. The next moment we saw the door of the cottage
open, and the master ran out with a cloak round his head,
to keep himself from being choked by the smoke, and with
a sword in his hand. As soon as he was clear of the
burning cottage he threw down the cloak and rushed
straight at the nearest Persian. The man turned and ran.
There was not one of them that dared stand for a moment.
But they shot at him with arrows. They had fastened the
gates of the enclosure in which the cottages stood, you must
understand, so that he could not escape. In fact he was
climbing over one of them when he was killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you; what did you do?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; cried the man, &ldquo;we were helpless, we had not
a sword between us. We hid ourselves, and the next morning
took our master&rsquo;s body and carried it to Timandra. She
made a great funeral, spending upon it, poor thing, nearly
every drachma she had. When we had seen the last of
my dear master, the secretary said that he had friends at
Tarsus, and set out to go there. I thought that I had best
make my way to Smyrna. Thanks to your goodness, I
shall now be able to get there, but I was very nearly dying
of starvation. But what, if I may ask, are you thinking of
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; replied the Athenian; &ldquo;as I told you,
I was on my way to Alcibiades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I can tell you this,&rdquo; rejoined the stranger, &ldquo;no
friends of my master&rsquo;s will be safe here. Pharnabazus, I
feel sure, had no great love for him, notwithstanding all his
politeness; as for the Spartans, they hated him; and I did
hear that the people who are now in power at Athens had
sent to say that peace could not last unless he were put out
of the way. Yes, sir, if anyone recognizes that you are my
master&rsquo;s friend, you are a dead man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;I have made no secret of it. In
Smyrna I spoke about him to the people with whom I was
staying. No one said a word against him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely not,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;for they thought
that he was alive, and no one liked to have my master for
an enemy. He had a wonderful way of making friends to
have the upper hand and contriving that his adversaries
should have the worst of it. But now that he is dead you
will find things very different.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; asked the young Athenian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you trust your guide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the man. I simply hired him because
I was told that he was a fairly honest fellow, knew
the country very well, and would not run away if a robber
made his appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him that you have a headache, and that you will
come on after him when you have rested a little and the sun
is not so hot, and that he had better go on, get quarters at
the next stage and have everything ready for you when you
shall arrive. As soon as he is gone, get back as fast as you
can to Smyrna. The news will hardly have reached that
place yet, indeed we may be sure that it has not, or you
would have heard of it before you started. Go down to the
docks, and take your passage in any ship that you can find
ready to start. Even if it is going to Athens never mind;
you will be able to leave it on the way. Anyhow, get out
of Asia at any risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no one will care about me. I am a very insignificant
person. But, as a matter of fact, I shall try to get to Syracuse.
I was born there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Syracuse will do as well for me as any other place. Why
not come with me if it can be managed? I was able to do
you a little service, and you have done me a great one. Let
us go together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plan was carried out with the greatest success. Callias
made the best of his way to Smyrna, and left his horse at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
an inn, not, of course, the one from which he had started. As
he had plenty of money for immediate wants, besides letters
of credit from Hippocles, he thought it safer not to attempt
to sell the animal. He then provided himself with different
clothes, purchasing at the same time a suit for his new acquaintance.
These he ordered to be sent to a small house of
entertainment near the docks which they had arranged
should be the place of meeting. Shortly before sunset the
man appeared. Meanwhile Callias had arranged for a passage
for himself and his servant in a ship bound for Corinth.
They would not venture into Corinth itself, but would
transfer themselves at the port of Cenchreae into some ship
bound for Sicily.</p>

<p>Before the morning of the next day the two were on their
way westward. Everything went well. At Cenchreae they
found a Syracusan merchantman just about to start, shipped
on board her and after a prosperous voyage found themselves
in the chief city of Sicily.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>DIONYSIUS.</small></h2>


<p>It was with no common emotion that the young Athenian
entered the great harbor of Syracuse. It was here that
the really fatal blow had been struck from which his
country had never recovered. She had struggled gallantly
on for nearly ten years after she had lost the most magnificent
armament that she had ever sent forth, but the wound
had been mortal. Thenceforward she had been as a man of
whose life-blood a half had been drained away. Callias had
read, shortly before leaving Athens for the last time, the magnificent
passage, then recently published, in which the
great historian of Athens had described the decisive battle
in the harbor.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The sight of the place now enabled him to
realize it to himself in the most vivid way. He seemed to
see the hostile fleets crowded together in a way for which
there was no precedent, two hundred war galleys in a space
so narrow that man&#339;uvre was impossible, and nothing
availed but sheer fighting and hard blows; while the shores
seemed alive again as they had been on that eventful day
with a crowd of eager spectators, the armies of the two contending
powers, who looked on with passionate cries and
gestures at such a spectacle as human eyes had scarcely wit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>nessed
before, a mighty war-game in which their own liberties
and lives were the stake. The heights that ran above
the harbor were scarcely less significant. There, its remains
still visible, had been the Athenian line of investment.
If only a few yards more had been completed, the
young man thought to himself, the whole course of history
might have been changed.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Not far away was the spot
where the sturdy infantry of Thebes had withstood the fiery
shock of his own countrymen, and so, not for the first time,
wrested from them the empire that seemed almost within
their grasp.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> And somewhere&mdash;no one knew where&mdash;his own
father had fallen, one of the thousands of noble victims who
had been sacrificed to the greed and ambition of a restless
democracy.</p>

<p>The noble house of which Callias was the representative
had, of course, its hereditary guest-friend at Syracuse.
Naturally there had been very little intercourse between
citizens of the two states in late years; but the old tie remained
unbroken, and Medon, for that was the Syracusan&rsquo;s
name, was as ready to give a hospitable welcome to the
young Athenian, as if he had been a citizen of one of his
country&rsquo;s allies, a merchant prince of Corinth, or a scion of
one of the two royal houses of Sparta. He insisted upon his
guest taking up his quarters in his house, and exerted himself
to the utmost to supply and even anticipate every
want.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you have seen something of the outside of our city,&rdquo;
said Medon to his friend as they sat together after the evening
meal on the third day after his arrival, &ldquo;you should
know something of its politics. But first let me make sure
that we are alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dining chamber in which the two were sitting had an
ante-room. The door of this the Syracusan proceeded to
bolt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we shall have no eavesdroppers. Any
inquisitive friend may listen at that other door, with all
this space between us and him, without getting much idea
of what we are talking about. All the other walls are outer
walls, as you know, and unless a certain great personage has
the birds of the air in his pay, we may talk without reserve.
You look surprised. Well, you will understand
things a little better when you have heard what I have to tell
you. You know something, I suppose, of what has been happening
here of late years. The fact is we have been going
through an awful time. No sooner were we free of the
danger that you put us in&mdash;you must pardon me for alluding
to it&mdash;than we were confronted with another which was
every whit as formidable. Another wretched quarrel between
two towns in the island&mdash;curiously enough the very
same two that were concerned in your expedition against
us<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>&mdash;brought in a foreign invader. This time it was the
Carthaginians. They had had settlements in the island
for many years, had always coveted the dominion of
the whole, and more than once had been very near
getting it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> They were not far from success this time. First they took
Selinus and massacred every creature in it; then they took
Acragas;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> then they utterly destroyed Himera. Something
made them hold their hands, and we had a short breathing
space. Four years afterwards they came back in greater
force than ever. Acragas was besieged; it held out bravely,
but at last the population had to leave it; only Syracuse was
left. Again when in the full tide of victory, the Carthaginians
held their hand. Do you ask me why? I cannot tell
you. But listen to the fourth article of the treaty of peace.&rdquo;
In spite of the precautions that he had taken against being
overheard, Medon, at this point lowered his voice. &ldquo;Syracuse
is to be under the rule of Dionysius. Yes; the secret
is there; it was he that made it worth their while to go;
and you may be sure that it was worth his while to buy
them off. I must allow that he was the only man who
showed a grain of sense or courage in the whole matter; the
other generals as they were called were hopelessly imbecile.
Well, they went, and Dionysius became, shall we
call it, &lsquo;commander-in-chief,&rsquo; or perhaps as we are quite
alone, &lsquo;tyrant?&rsquo; He had not an easy time of it at first; I
don&rsquo;t suppose that he will ever have an easy time, tyrants
seldom do. The nobles and the heads of the democratic
party leagued together against him, and drove him out.
That did not last long. Of course the conquerors used their
victory most brutally. They were furious that Dionysius
had slipped out of their hands, and wreaked their vengeance
on his poor wife. I can&rsquo;t tell you the horrible way in which
they killed her. She was the daughter, too, of Hermo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>crates,
one of the very best and noblest men that Syracuse
ever had. Equally of course they quarrelled over the spoils.
Naturally, before long they had nothing left to quarrel
over. Dionysius hired a force of Campanian mercenaries,
the hardest hitters, by the way, that I ever saw, and drove
them out of the city. Now, I fancy, he is pretty firmly
seated. The people like him; they were never as fit, you
must know, for popular government as yours are. He gives
them plenty of employment and amusements, wrings the
money out of us with a tight hand, and scatters it among
them with an open one. Of course a dagger may reach him,
and there are not a few that are kept ready sharpened for
the chance. Barring that, he is likely to be master here as
long as he lives. And to tell you the truth, though personally
I hate the idea, as any noble must&mdash;it is the nobles that always
hate a tyrant most&mdash;yet I do not see that anything
could be better for Syracuse. The Carthaginian danger
is not over yet, and Dionysius is the very ablest soldier
and administrator that we have. Of course the
pinch will come later. A ruler of this sort always
becomes harder, more cruel, more suspicious as he
grows older. And if he has a son, brought up in the
bad atmosphere of tyranny, the country has a terrible
time of it. Happily the son is generally a fool,
and brings the whole thing down with a crash. But
all this is far off. Dionysius is still a young man,
not more than twenty-six years old, I fancy. However,
you shall see him&mdash;we are very good friends in
public&mdash;and judge for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias, who had the hereditary abhorrence of his race for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
anything like tyranny,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> demurred at the proposed introduction
to the despot. Medon was very urgent in overruling
his objection. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mistake Sicily for Greece,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;we are half barbarous, and what would be monstrous
with you is quite in its right place here. I grant you that
an honest man should have no dealings with a tyrant who
should set himself up at Thebes, or Corinth, or Argos. But
it is different here. I am sure that the man governs us better
than we should be governed by the people, or, for the
matter of that, by the nobles either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last the Athenian consented. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; cried
Medon, &ldquo;you will go. Then we will lose no time about it.
Depend upon it, Dionysius knows all about you; and if you
do not pay your respects to him without loss of time he will
be suspicious. Suspicion is the bane of his situation. Servant,
friend, wife; he trusts nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Medon and his guest presented themselves
at the palace. The Athenian had half turned back when
he found that he must be searched. No one was admitted
into the presence until that precaution had been taken, and
his freeman&rsquo;s pride revolted. Medon simply shrugged his
shoulders. &ldquo;He is quite right,&rdquo; he whispered to his indignant
friend, &ldquo;he would not live a month if he did not do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dionysius was, or pretended to be, busy with his studies,
when the two visitors were announced. A slave was reading
to him from a roll, and he was taking notes on a wax<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
tablet. He welcomed the newcomers with much cordiality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Medon, you have brought your Athenian friend at
last. I hope that you have not been slandering me to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered Medon with a courtly bow, &ldquo;I have
told him the history of the last five years, and have taken
him to see Syracuse. That is not the way to slander you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Dionysius, &ldquo;I shall have you a courtier yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then turned to the Athenian, asked him a few questions,
all with the nicest tact, about his movements, and
finally named a time when he should be at leisure to have
some real conversation with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I honor the Athenians more
than any other people in Greece; a strange thing you may
think for a Syracusan to say, but it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly when Callias presented himself at the appointed
time, everything that his royal host had said seemed to bear
out this assurance. &ldquo;After to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;politics shall be
banished from our talk. Don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment that if
I had been a citizen of Athens, I should have attempted, that
I should even have wished, to be what I am here. But Syracuse
is not capable of being what Athens is. Even you find
liberty a little hard to manage sometimes. Here it is a
farce, only a very bloody farce. Listen to what happened
to my father-in-law, Hermocrates. There never was an
abler man in the country. If it had not been for him, I
verily believe that you would have conquered us. He saved
the city; and then, a little time afterwards, because he did
not do what ten years before no one would have dreamt of
doing, that is, conquer you Athenians in a sea-fight, they
banished him. Can you imagine such ingratitude, such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
folly? Well; he was not disposed to put up with it; he saw
what I see, that the Syracusans are not fit to govern themselves,
and if it had not been for an accident, perhaps I ought
rather to say his own reckless courage, he would have been
in my place now.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> What he intended to do I have done. I
saved Syracuse as he saved her from Athens; and I dare say
that in a year or two my grateful countrymen would have
banished me as they banished him. Only I have been beforehand
with them. So much for politics; now let us talk
of something more pleasant and more profitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me now, do you know one Socrates in your city, a
very wise man they tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he is wise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed; there is no one like him; and so the god
thought, for the Pythia declared him to be the wisest of
men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should dearly like to see him. Do you think it likely
that he would come here, if I were to invite him? I would
make it worth his while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear there is no chance of it. He never leaves Athens;
never has left it except when he served abroad with the
army, and as for money, he is quite careless about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he takes a fee for his teaching, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a drachma.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that astonishes me. Why, Georgias would not
teach anyone for less than half a talent, and has got together,
I suppose, a pretty heap of money by this time.
But, perhaps, if I could not get the great man himself, I
might get one of his disciples. Whom do men reckon to be
the first among them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that one Plato is the most famous. He was a
poet when he was quite young, indeed he is young now,
and had a great reputation; but he has given up poetry for
philosophy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems a pity. I don&rsquo;t see why a man should not
be both poet and philosopher. I am a little of both myself.
Can you remember anything that he has written?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; there was an epigram which everyone was repeating
when I left Athens. It was written for the tomb of one
of his fellow disciples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias repeated,</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;In life like Morning star thy shining head;<br />
And now the star of Evening &rsquo;mid the dead.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very pretty indeed. I have something very like it of
my own. Would you like to hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias of course politely assented and expressed as much
admiration as his conscience permitted, possibly a little
more, for the composition was vapid and clumsy.</p>

<p>But though Dionysius was an indifferent composer, he
had really a very strong interest in literary matters. Personal
vanity had something to do with it, for he was fully
convinced of his own abilities in this way; but he had a
genuine pleasure in talking on the subject. This was indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the first of many conversations which the young Athenian
had with him. Politics were never mentioned again, but
poetry, the drama, indeed every kind of literary work, supplied
topics of unfailing interest. The drama was, perhaps,
the despot&rsquo;s favorite topic. He had received not long before
Callias&rsquo; arrival, a copy of the play which was
described in my first chapter, and was never tired of
asking questions about various points of interest in it.
It soon became evident that his special ambition lay in this
direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, now that your two great men are gone,&rdquo; he said to
the young Athenian, &ldquo;you have no man of really the first
rank among your dramatists?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; replied Callias. &ldquo;Some think well of
Iophon, who is the son of Sophocles. Others say that he
would be nothing without his father. They declare that
the old man helped him when he was alive, and that what
he has brought out since his father&rsquo;s death is really not his
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dionysius, &ldquo;the stock will be exhausted
before long. And there is no one, you say, besides
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, certainly of any reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there would be a chance for an outsider? But
would a dramatist that was not an Athenian be allowed to
exhibit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing to the contrary. But I do not know
that there has ever been a case. Anyhow it would be easy
to exhibit in the name of a citizen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent idea! I shall certainly manage it somehow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
The first prize at your festival would be almost as well
worth having as the tyranny itself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that a ruler who cherished such tastes
should have reckoned a library among the ornaments which
were to make Syracuse the most splendid among Greek
cities. In his Athenian guest he believed himself to have
found a competent agent for carrying this purpose into
effect; and Callias was in truth a well educated person
who knew what books were worth buying. He was
well acquainted with the literature of his own country and
had a fairly competent knowledge of what had been produced
elsewhere in Greece. For the next three years it was
his employment, and one, on the whole not uncongenial to
his tastes, to collect volumes for Dionysius. In Sicily there
was little culture, but the Greek cities of Italy furnished
a more fertile field. There was not indeed much in the way
of <i>belles-lettres</i>. Works of this kind had to be imported
for the most part, either from Athens, or from Lesbos,
where the traditions of the school of Sappho and Alc&aelig;us
were not extinct, but books on philosophy and science,
could be secured in considerable numbers. At Crotona, for
instance, Callias was fortunate enough to secure a valuable
scientific library which had been for some years in the
family of Democedes, while at Tarentum he purchased a
handsome collection of treatises by teachers of the school of
Pythagoras.</p>

<p>This occupation was varied in the second year of his resi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>dence
by an interesting mission to Rome. That city, the
rising greatness of which so keen an observer as Dionysius
was able to discern, was at this time sorely distressed by a
visitation of famine, and had applied far and wide for help.
The harvests of Sicily had been remarkably abundant, and
Dionysius sent a magnificent present of a hundred thousand
bushels of wheat, putting Callias in charge of the mission.</p>

<p>In spite of these honorable and not distasteful employments
the young Athenian did not greatly like his position.
It would indeed have been scarcely endurable to a soul that
had been reared in an atmosphere of liberty, but for the fact
that his work took him much away from Syracuse. Dionysius
was all courtesy and generosity in his dealings with him;
but he was a tyrant; there was iron under his velvet glove.
It was therefore with a considerable feeling of relief that in
the early spring of the third (or according to classical
reckoning) the fourth year after the fall of Athens, he received
a missive from Xenophon couched in the following
terms.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me at Tarsus with all the speed you can. Great
things lie before us, of which you will hear more at the
proper time. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leave of absence was obtained with some difficulty, and
towards the end of June, Callias found himself at the appointed
place.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>CYRUS THE YOUNGER.</small></h2>


<p>Almost the first person that the Athenian saw when he
disembarked at Tarsus was Xenophon. The latter was evidently
in the highest spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are come at exactly the right moment,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;All is going well; but, three days ago, I should have said
that all would end badly. Cyrus and Clearchus have
thrown for great stakes, and they have won; but at first the
dice were against them. But I forget; you know nothing
of what happened. I will explain. You know something
about Cyrus, the Great King&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that he was scarcely contented to be what he
was, in fact that he was disposed to claim the throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard some talk of the kind when I was with
Alcibiades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen then to what happened. Cyrus, to put a long
story in a few words, collected by one means or another
about thirteen thousand Greek soldiers. He gave out that
he was going to lead them against the mountain tribes of
Cilicia. But his real object has all along been to march up
to Susa, and drive the King from his throne. Clearchus
knew this; I fancy some others guessed it; I know I did for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
one. But the army knew nothing about it. Of course it
had to come out at last. When we came to Tarsus, the men
had to be told. If we were going to act against the Cicilian
mountaineers, now was the time. If not, why had we been
brought so far? When the truth was known there was a
frightful uproar. The men declared that they would go
back. It was madness, they said, for a few thousand men to
march against the Great King. For four days I thought all
was lost. Clearchus and Cyrus managed admirably. I will
tell you all about it some day. Meanwhile it is enough to
say that all is settled. The men have changed their tone
completely. They talk of nothing but ransacking the
treasuries of the King, and Cyrus is quite magnificent in his
promises. He gives a great banquet to the officers to-night.
I am going with Proxenus, who is my special friend among
the generals, and I have no doubt that I can take you.
Cyrus, I assure you, is a man worth knowing, and, though
we should call him a barbarian, worth serving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Persian prince, when Callias came to make his acquaintance,
bore out, and more than bore out, the high
character which Xenophon had given of him. A more
princely man in look and bearing never lived. That he was
a stern ruler was well known, but his subjects needed stern
methods; but for courtesy and generosity he could not be
matched, and he had that genial manner which makes
these qualities current coin in the market of the world. He
was of unusual stature, his frame well knit and well proportioned,
and his face, though slightly disfigured by scars
which he had received in early life in a fierce death struggle
with a bear, singularly handsome. Proxenus introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
his friend&rsquo;s friend as a young Athenian who had come to
put his sword at his disposal, and Cyrus at once greeted
him with that manner of friendliness and even comradeship
which made him so popular. At the same time he made
some complimentary remark about Athens, saying that the
Athenians had been formidable enemies, and would hereafter,
he hoped, be valuable friends.</p>

<p>The banquet could not fail, under such circumstances, of
being a great success. Everyone was in the highest spirits, and
when Cyrus, in thanking his guests for their company,
said that though Greece and Persia had been enemies in the
past they would be firm friends in the future, he was greeted
with a burst of tumultuous applause.</p>

<p>The next day the army set out, their last remaining
scruples dispelled by an increase of pay.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> There was still a
certain reserve in speaking about the object of the campaign
but every one knew that it was directed against the Great
King. Two days&rsquo; march took them to Issi, a town destined
to become famous in later days.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The difficult pass of the
Cicilian Gate was found unguarded. About a month later
the ford of the Euphrates at Thapsacus<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> was reached.
Then all disguise was thrown off. Cyrus was marching
against his brother, and he would give each man a bonus of
a year&rsquo;s pay when he had reached Babylon.</p>

<p>So the long and tedious march went on. The King made
no signs of resistance. Line after line of defense was found
unguarded. At last, just ten weeks after the army had
marched out of Tarsus, a Persian horseman attached to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Cyrus&rsquo; person, came galloping up with the news, which he
shouted out in Greek and Persian, &ldquo;The King is coming
with a great army ready for battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something like a panic followed, for the invaders had almost
begun to think that they would not have to fight.
Cyrus sprang from the carriage in which he had been riding,
donned his corslet, and mounted his charger; the Greeks rushed
to the wagons in which they had deposited their armor
and weapons, and prepared themselves hastily for battle.</p>

<p>By mid-day all was ready. Clearchus was in command of
the right wing, which consisted of the heavy-armed
Greeks, and rested on the Euphrates the light-armed
Greeks, with some Paphlagonian cavalry, stood in the
center; on the left were the Persians under Ari&aelig;us, Cyrus&rsquo;
second in command. The extreme left of all was occupied
by Cyrus himself with his body guard of six hundred horsemen.
All wore cuirasses, cuisses and helmets; but Cyrus,
wishing to be easily recognized, rode bareheaded.</p>

<p>It was afternoon before the enemy came in sight. First,
a white cloud of dust became visible; then something like
a black pall spread far and wide over the plain, with now
and then a spear point or bronze helmet gleaming through
the darkness. Silently the huge host advanced, its left on
the river, its right far overlapping Cyrus&rsquo; left, so great was
its superiority in numbers. &ldquo;Strike at the center,&rdquo; said
the Prince to Clearchus, as he rode along the line, &ldquo;then
our work will be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew his countrymen; the King himself was in the
center. If he should be killed or driven from the field, victory
was assured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The hostile lines were only two furlongs apart, when the
Greeks raised the battle shout, and charged at a quick pace,
which soon became a run. A few minutes afterwards the
Persians broke. Their front line, consisting of scythe-armed
chariots, for the most part, turned and drove helter skelter
through the ranks of their countrymen; the few that
charged the advancing foe did, perhaps attempted to do, no
harm. The ranks were opened to let them through, and
they took no further part in the battle. Anyhow the
Greeks won the victory without losing a single man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King, posted, as has been said, in the
center, seeing no one to oppose him, advanced as if he would
take the Greeks on their flank. Cyrus, seeing this, charged
with his six hundred, and broke the line in front of the
King. The troopers were scattered in the ardor of pursuit,
and the Prince was left alone with a handful of men. Even
then all might have been well but for the fit of ungovernable
rage which seized him. He spied his brother the King
in the throng, and, crying out, &ldquo;There is the man,&rdquo; pressed
furiously towards him. One blow he dealt him, piercing
his corslet, and making a slight wound. Then one
of the King&rsquo;s attendants struck Cyrus with a javelin
under the eye. The two brothers closed for a moment
in a hand-to-hand struggle. But Cyrus and his followers were
hopelessly overmatched. In a few minutes the Prince and
eight of his companions were stretched on the ground.
One desperate effort was made to save him. Artapates, the
closest of his friends, leaped from his horse, and threw
his arms around his body. It did but delay the fatal blow
for the briefest space. The next moment Cyrus was dead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>THE RETREAT.</small></h2>


<p>Seven weeks have passed since the catastrophe recorded
in my last chapter.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Curiously enough the Greeks had returned
to their camp after their easily won victory without
any suspicion of what had happened on the other side of the
battle field. They wondered, indeed, that Cyrus neither
came nor sent to congratulate them on their success, but the
news of his death which was brought to them next morning
by an Ionian Greek, who had been in the service of Cyrus,
came upon them like a thunderclap. Then had followed a
period of indecision and perplexity. So long as they had to
answer insolent messages from the King or Tissaphernes,
bidding them give up their arms and be
content with such chance of pardon as they might
have, their course was plain. To such demands only
one answer was possible. &ldquo;We will die sooner than give
them up,&rdquo; had been the reply which Cleanor the Arcadian,
the senior officer, had made. But when the Persians began
to treat, when they agreed upon a truce, and even allowed
the Greeks to provision themselves, the course to be followed
became less plain. Tissaphernes made indeed the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
liberal offers. &ldquo;We will lead you back to Greece,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and find you provisions at a fair price. If we do not
furnish them, you are at liberty to take them for yourselves,
only you must swear that you will behave as if you were
marching through the country of friends.&rdquo; There were
some who roundly said that the Greeks had best have no
dealings with the man; he was known to be treacherous
and false; this was only his way of luring them on to their
death. On the other hand it was difficult to refuse terms so
advantageous. It was possible that the satrap, though not
in the least friendly, was genuinely afraid, and would be
glad to get rid at any price of visitants so unwelcome. This
was the common opinion. If the army could find its way
home without fighting, it would be madness to reject the
chance. For many days past, every thing had gone smoothly;
relations between the Greeks and Tissaphernes seemed to
become more and more friendly. Clearchus, the general,
commanding in chief, had even dined with the satrap, had
been treated in the most friendly fashion, and was now
come back to the camp with a proposition from him for a
formal conference at which the Greeks were to be represented
by their principal generals. Some voices were
raised against this proposal. &ldquo;No one ever trusted Tissaphernes
without repenting it,&rdquo; was the sentiment of not a
few, Xenophon amongst the number. But the opposition
was overruled. Five generals and twenty inferior officers
proceeded to the tent of Tissaphernes, followed by a troop of
stragglers, who availed themselves of the favorable opportunity,
as they thought it, of marketing within the enemy&rsquo;s
lines.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Callias,&rdquo; said Xenophon to his friend on the morning of
this eventful day, &ldquo;my mind misgives me. The soothsayer
tells me that, though the sacrifices have been generally
favorable, there have always been some sinister indications.
And certain it is that we have never put ourselves so completely
in the enemy&rsquo;s power as we have this day. Tissaphernes
has only to say the word and our most skillful leaders
are dead men. But, hark, what is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cry of surprise and wrath went up from the camp, and
the two Athenians rushed out of the tent in which they had
been sitting, to ascertain the cause. One glance was
enough. The stragglers were hurrying back at the top of
their speed with the Persians in hot pursuit. Among the
foremost of the fugitives was an Arcadian officer, who, fearfully
wounded as he was, managed to make his way to
the camp. &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Clearchus and the rest
are either dead or prisoners.&rdquo; Instantly there was a wild
rush for arms. Everyone expected that the next moment
would bring the whole Persian army in sight. But the
King and his satraps knew how formidable the Greeks
really were. As long as they had a chance of succeeding by
fraud, they would not use force.</p>

<p>Fraud was immediately attempted. Ari&aelig;us, who by this
time had made his peace with the King, rode up to within
a short distance of the camp, and said, &ldquo;Let the Greeks
send some one that is in authority to bear a message from
the King.&rdquo; The veteran Cleanor accordingly went forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you,&rdquo; cried Xenophon, &ldquo;I am eager to
hear what has become of my friend Proxenus. Come you,
too,&rdquo; he whispered to Callias.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Ari&aelig;us addressed them: &ldquo;Thus saith the King;
Clearchus, having forsworn himself and broken the truth,
has been put to death. Proxenus and Medon are honorably
treated. As for you, the King demands your arms, seeing
that they belonged to Cyrus, who was his slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cleanor&rsquo;s answer was brief and emphatic, &ldquo;Thou villain,
Ari&aelig;us, and the rest of you, have you no shame before gods
or men, that you betray us in this fashion, and make friends
with that perjurer Tissaphernes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ari&aelig;us could only repeat that Clearchus was a traitor.
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Xenophon, &ldquo;why send us not back Proxenus
and Medon, good men you say, who would advise both
you and us for the best?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this no answer was made; and the party slowly made
their way back to the camp. The worst had happened.
They were in the midst of their enemies, more than a thousand
miles from the sea, and they had lost their leaders.</p>

<p>The two Athenians, who shared the same tent, lay down
to rest at an early hour. It still wanted some time to midnight,
when Xenophon surprised his companion by suddenly
starting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;all will be well after all. I have
had a most encouraging dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;that I was at home and
that there was a great storm of thunder and lightning and
that the lightning struck the house and that it blazed up all
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias stared. &ldquo;But that does not sound very encouraging.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but listen to what I have to tell you. When
Proxenus asked me to come with him on this expedition, I
applied to Socrates for his advice. &lsquo;Ask the god at Delphi,&rsquo;
he said. So I asked the god but not, as he meant me to do,
whether I should go or not, but to what gods, if I went, I
should sacrifice. Well, this has been a great trouble to me,
and I look upon this dream as an answer. First&mdash;this is
the encouragement&mdash;Zeus shows me a light in darkness.
The house all on a blaze, I take it, means that we are surrounded
with dangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it turn out well,&rdquo; was all that Callias could find it in
his heart to say. But if he was tempted to think meanly
of his companion, he had soon reason to alter his opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whether my dream means what I think or any thing
else,&rdquo; Xenophon went on, &ldquo;we must act. To fall into the
hands of the King means death, and death in the most
shameful form. And yet no one stirs hand or foot to avoid
it; we lie quiet, as though it were time to take our rest. I
shall go and talk to my comrades about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first thing was to call together his own particular
friends, the officers of Proxenus&rsquo; division. He found them
as wakeful as himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must get out of the King&rsquo;s
clutches. You know what he did to his own brother. The
man was dead; but he must nail his body to a cross. What
will he do, think you, to us? No; we must get out of his
reach. But how? Not by making terms with him. That
only gives him time to hem us in more and more completely.
No; we must fight him; and we, who are more
enduring and brave than our enemies, have a right to hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
that we shall fight to good purpose. And surely the gods
will help us rather than them. For are they not faithless
and forsworn?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, if we are to fight, we must have leaders. Let us
choose them then. As for me, I will follow another, or, if
you will have it so, I will lead myself. Young I am, but I
am at least of an age to take care of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a loud cry&mdash;&ldquo;Xenophon for general!&rdquo;
Only one voice was raised in protest, that of a captain, who
spoke in very broad B&#339;otian. &ldquo;Escape is impossible; we
should better try persuasion.&rdquo; Such was the burden of his
speech.</p>

<p>Xenophon turned on him fiercely. &ldquo;Escape impossible!
And yet you know what the King did. First came a
haughty command that we should give up our arms. When
we refused, he took to soft words and cajolery. He is afraid
of us; but if we trust to persuasion we are lost.&rdquo; Then turning
to the others, he cried, &ldquo;Is this man fit to be a captain?
Make him a bearer of burdens. He is a disgrace to the
name of Greek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greek,&rdquo; cried an Arcadian captain, &ldquo;he is no B&#339;otian,
nor Greek at all. He is a Mysian slave. I see his ears are
bored.&rdquo; And the man was promptly turned out of camp.</p>

<p>Not a moment was now lost. A representative body of
officers from the whole army was promptly collected, and
Xenophon was asked to repeat what he had said to the smaller
gathering. The meeting ended in the election of five
generals to replace those who had been murdered. Chirisophus,
a Spartan, made the sixth, having held the office
before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The day was now beginning to dawn. It was scarcely
light when the whole army assembled in obedience to a
hasty summons which had been sent through the camp.</p>

<p>Chirisophus opened the proceedings. &ldquo;We have fared
ill, fellow soldiers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in that we have been robbed
of so many officers and have been deserted by our allies.
Still we must not give in. If we cannot conquer, at least
we can die gloriously. Anyhow we must not fall alive into
the hands of the King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After an address by another general, Xenophon stood up.
He had dressed himself in his best apparel. &ldquo;Fine clothes
will suit victory best,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and if I die, let
me at least die like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if we were going to treat with the
barbarians, then, knowing how faithless they are, we might
well despair; but if we mean, taking our good swords
in our hands, to punish them for what they have done,
and to secure our own safety, then we may hope for the
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point, a soldier sneezed. A sneeze was a lucky
omen, and by a common impulse all the soldiers bowed
their heads. Xenophon seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I spoke of safety, gentlemen, and as I was speaking,
Zeus the Savior, sent us an omen of good fortune. Let us
therefore vow to him a thank-offering for deliverance, if we
ever reach our native country. This let us do as an army;
and besides, let everyone vow to offer according to his ability
in return for his own safe arrival.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These propositions were unanimously accepted, and the
hymn of battle was solemnly sung by the whole army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the speaker, &ldquo;we have set ourselves right
with the gods, who will doubtless reward our piety, while
they will punish these perjurers and traitors who seek to
destroy us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, after appealing to the glorious memories of the
past, when the Greeks, fighting against overwhelming odds,
had once and again turned back the tide of Persian invasion,
he addressed himself to deal with the circumstances of the
situation. &ldquo;Our allies have deserted us; but we shall fight
better without such cowards. We have no cavalry; but battles
are won by the sword; our foes will have the better only
in being able to run away more quickly. No market will
be given us; but it is better to take our food than to buy it.
If rivers bar our way, we have only to cross them higher
up. Verily, I believe that not only can we get away, but
that if the King saw us preparing to settle here, he would be
glad to send us away in coaches and four, so terribly afraid
is he of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how shall we go? Let us burn our tents and all
superfluous baggage. The baggage too often commands the
army. That is the first thing to do. Our arms are our
chief possession. If we use them aright, everything in the
country is ours. Let us march in a hollow square, with the
baggage animals and the camp followers in the middle.
And let us settle at once who is to command each section of
the army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this was accepted without demur. Chirisophus was
appointed to command the van, Xenophon, with a colleague,
as the youngest of the generals, the rear. Practically these
two divided the command between them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>The first experience of an encounter with the enemy was
not reassuring; in fact it was almost disastrous. Early in
the first day&rsquo;s march, one Mithridates, a personage well
known to the Greeks, for he had been high in Cyrus&rsquo; confidence,
rode up with a couple of hundred horsemen and
twice as many slingers and bowmen. He had a look of
coming as a friend; indeed, earlier in that day he had come
with what purported to be a conciliatory message from Tissaphernes.
But on arriving within a moderate distance of
the Greeks he halted, and the next moment there was a
shower of bullets and arrows from the slings and bows.
The Greeks were helpless. They suffered severely, but
could do nothing to the enemy in return. The Cretan
archers had a shorter range than that of the Persian bows,
and the javelin could not, of course, come anywhere near the
slingers. At last Xenophon gave the order to charge.
Charge the men did, heavy-armed and light-armed alike.
Possibly it was better than standing still to be shot at. But
they did not contrive to catch a single man. As foot soldiers
they were fairly outpaced; and they had no cavalry.
Only three miles were accomplished that day, and the army
reached the villages in which they were to bivouac, in a
state of great despondency. Unless such attacks could be
resisted with better success, the fate of the army was sealed.</p>

<p>Xenophon was severely blamed by his colleagues for his
action in charging. He frankly acknowledged his fault.
&ldquo;I could not stand still,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and see the men falling
round me without striking a blow, but the charge was no
good. We caught none of them, and we did not find it
easy to get back. Thanks to the gods, there were not very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
many of them; if they had come on in force, we must have
been cut to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a short silence, he addressed his colleagues again.
&ldquo;We are at a great disadvantage. Our Cretans cannot
shoot as far as their Persian archers; and our hand throwers
are useless against the slingers. As for the foot soldiers,
no man, however fleet of foot, can overtake another who has
a bowshot&rsquo;s start of him, especially as we cannot push the
pursuit far from the main body. The simple truth is that we
must have slingers and horsemen of our own. I know that
there are Rhodians in the army who can sling leaden bullets
to a much greater distance than these Persian slings
can reach. I propose, first, that we find out who among
them have slings of their own; these we will buy at the
proper value; if any know how to plait some more, we will
pay them the proper price for doing it; the slings thus obtained,
we shall soon get a corps of slingers to use them.
Give them some advantage and they will enroll themselves
fast enough. Now for the cavalry. We have some horses I
know. There are some in the rear-guard with me; there
are others that belonged to Clearchus; a good many have
been taken from the enemy, and are being used as baggage
animals. Let us take the pick of these and equip them for
the use of cavalry; we shall soon have some very capable
horsemen at our service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea was promptly carried out. That very night a
couple of hundred slingers were enrolled, and the next day,
which was spent without any attempt to advance, fifty
horsemen passed muster, fairly well-mounted and duly furnished
with buff jackets and cuirasses. This was only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
first of many instances in which Xenophon showed the
fertility and readiness of device which did so much to save
the army.</p>

<p>The very next day the new forces were brought into action
with the happiest results. Mithridates came up again
with his archers and slingers, but encountered a reception
on which he had not calculated. The cavalry made a brilliant
charge, cutting down a number of the infantry and
taking prisoners some seventeen horsemen. At the end of
the day&rsquo;s march, the army reached the Tigris. Fourteen
weeks of hard and perilous marching lay before them; but
they were fairly well-equipped for the work. I shall take
an account of some of the principal incidents of the journey
from a diary kept by Callias, who acted throughout as aid-de-camp
to Xenophon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>THE DIARY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">October 27.</span><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;Our new corps have covered themselves
with glory to-day. About noon Tissaphernes himself appeared
with a large force of cavalry. He had his own regiments
with him; among the others we recognized some of
Cyrus&rsquo; Persian troops. They want, I suppose, to make the
King forget their rebellion. The satrap did not wish to
come to close quarters; but he found after all that the quarters
were closer than he liked. He was well within range;
and as his men were posted in great masses every arrow and
every bullet told. It would, in fact, have been impossible
to miss, with such a mark to aim at. As for the Persian
archers they did no damage at all. But we found their arrows
very useful. Our men are now well-equipped, for we
discovered an abundant store of bow-strings and lead for the
sling bullets in the villages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 3.</span>&mdash;Things have not been going so well to-day.
The barbarians occupied a post of vantage on our route and
showered down darts, stones, and arrows upon us as we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
passed. Our light-armed were easily driven in. When the
heavy-armed tried to scale the height, they found the climbing
very hard work, and of course the enemy were gone by
the time that they reached the top. Three times this was
done, and I was never more pleased in my life than when at
last we got to the end of our day&rsquo;s march. Eight surgeons
are busy attending to the wounded, of whom there is a terrible
number. We are going to stop here three days, Xenophon
tells me. Meanwhile we are in a land of plenty.
There are granaries full of wheat, and cellars of wine, and
barley enough to supply our horses if we had fifty times as
many. Hereafter we are to follow a new plan. As soon as
we are attacked, we halt. To march and fight at the same
time puts us at a disadvantage. And we are to try to get
as far in advance as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 9.</span>&mdash;We had our three days&rsquo; rest, and then
three days&rsquo; quick marching. To-day, however, there has
been a smart brush with the enemy. They had occupied a
ridge commanding our route, which just then descended
from the hills into the plain. Chirisophus sent for Xenophon
to bring his light-armed to the front. This, of course,
was a serious thing to do, as Tissaphernes was not far from
our rear. Xenophon accordingly galloped to the front to
confer with his colleague. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, when he
saw how the enemy was posted, &ldquo;these fellows must be dislodged,
but we can&rsquo;t uncover our rear. You must give me
some troops, and I will do my best.&rdquo; Just at that moment
he caught sight of a height rising above us just on our right&mdash;he
has a true general&rsquo;s eye&mdash;and saw that it gave an approach
to the enemy&rsquo;s position. &ldquo;That is the place for us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to take,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If we get that, the barbarians can&rsquo;t stay
where they are.&rdquo; As soon as the troops were told off for
service, we started; and lo! as soon as we were off, the barbarians
seeing what we were after started too. It was a race
who should get there first. Xenophon rode beside the men,
and urged them on. &ldquo;Now for it, brave sirs!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for Hellas! &rsquo;Tis for wives and children! Win the race,
and you will march on in peace! Now for it!&rdquo; The men
did their best, but of course it was hard work. I never had
harder in my life. At last a grumbling fellow in the ranks
growled out, &ldquo;We are not on equal terms, Xenophon. You
are on horseback, and I have got to carry my shield.&rdquo; In a
moment Xenophon was off his horse. He snatched the fellow&rsquo;s
shield from him, and marched on with the rest. That
was hard work indeed, for he had his horseman&rsquo;s cuirass
on; still he kept up. Then the men fell on the grumbler.
They abused him, pelted him, and cuffed him, till he was
glad enough to take his shield again. Then Xenophon
re-mounted, and rode on as before as far as the horse
could go. Then he left him tethered to a tree, and went
on foot. In the end we won the race; and the barbarians
left the way clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 10.</span>&mdash;We had a great disappointment to-day.
The route lay either across a river which was too deep to
ford&mdash;we tried it with our spears, and could find no bottom&mdash;or
through a mountainous region inhabited by a set of
fierce savages whom the King has never been able to subdue.
He once sent an army of a hundred thousand men
among them, they say, and not a single soldier ever came
back! First we considered about crossing the river. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Rhodian had a grand plan, he said, for taking the army
across. He would sell it for a talent. I must confess, by the
way, that I am more and more disgusted by the manner in
which everything is for sale. Citizen soldiers think of the
common good, though, it must be confessed, they are not so
sturdy in action as these fellows; mercenaries think only of
the private purse. However, the Rhodian never got his
talent. His plan was clever enough, making floats of skins,
but impracticable, seeing that the enemy occupied the other
shore in force. Nothing, then, remained for it but to take
to the mountains. We must do our best to fight our way
through them, if the mountaineers won&rsquo;t be friends. This
done, we shall find ourselves in Armenia; once there, we
shall be able to go anywhere we please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 14.</span>&mdash;We have had three awful days. The
Carduchians&mdash;so they call the barbarians&mdash;are as hostile
and as fierce as they can be. It seems unreasonable, for
they must hate the Great King as much as we do. Still
they will not listen to our overtures for friendly intercourse,
but keep up an incessant attack. To-day there was very
near being a positive disaster. We in the rear-guard had,
of course, the worst of it. Generally when we find our work
particularly hard we pass on the word to the van, and they
slacken their pace; otherwise we should get divided from
the main army. To-day no attention was paid to our messages;
Chirisophus did nothing but send back word that
we must hurry on. Consequently our march became something
very like a rout, and we lost two of our best men.
At the first halt Xenophon rode to the front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why this hurry?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It has cost us two men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and we had to leave their bodies behind.&rdquo; &ldquo;See you that?&rdquo;
said Chirisophus, and he pointed to a height straight before
us, which was strongly held by the enemy. &ldquo;I wanted
to get there first, for the guide says that there is no other
way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Says he so?&rdquo; said Xenophon. &ldquo;Let us hear what
my fellows have to say. I laid an ambush, you must know,
and caught two barbarians. They would be useful, I
thought, as guides!&rdquo; The two were brought up and questioned.
&ldquo;Is there any other way than what we see?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the first. Try all we could, he would make no
other answer. At last Chirisophus had him killed.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, turning to the other, &ldquo;can you tell us anything
more?&rdquo; &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;there is another
way, and one that horses can pass over. But the other
would not say anything about it, because he had kinsfolk
living near it, and was afraid that you would do them an
injury.&rdquo; Poor fellow! I was sorry for him, when I knew
how loyal he had been. But I don&rsquo;t know what else could
have been done. The second man told us that there was a
height which we must occupy if we would make the new
route practicable. Two thousand men have set off to get
hold of it. If they fail, we shall be in terrible straits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 16.</span>&mdash;The army is safe for the present, but
some&mdash;I among the number&mdash;have had a very narrow escape.
The two thousand found their work very much
harder than at first they thought it was going to be. They
took the first height without any difficulty, and fancied
they had done all that was wanted. But there were no less
than three heights beyond, and each of these had to be
stormed. My part in the business was this. Xenophon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
thought that the second of the four heights&mdash;there were four
in all&mdash;ought to be held permanently till our army had
passed. Some two hundred men were told off for this duty,
and I volunteered to be one of them. All of a sudden we
found ourselves attacked by a whole swarm of mountaineers.
They outnumbered us by at least ten to one. It was a case
for running, for there was really no position that we could
hold. But running was no easy matter. Our only chance
was to climb down a very steep mountain side to the pass
below, where the last columns of the van-guard were just
making their way. Some of the men did not like to try it;
and, indeed, it did look desperately dangerous. While they
were hesitating, the barbarians were upon them. As for
myself, I felt that I would sooner break my neck than fall
into the enemy&rsquo;s hands, so I started off at full pace, and was
safe. Nor do I think that any who followed my example
were seriously hurt, though some got very nasty falls. Those
who stayed behind were killed to a man. Just now we are
in comfortable quarters. Wine is in such plenty hereabouts
that positively the people keep it in great cisterns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 19.</span>&mdash;We have crossed the Centrites, which is
the Eastern branch of the Tigris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November 30.</span>&mdash;The march through Armenia has been
on the whole as pleasant as we had hoped. The Lieutenant
Governor, one Tiribazus, made an agreement with our generals
that he would do us no harm, if we would not burn
the houses, but content ourselves with taking such provisions
as we wanted. Four days ago, we had a heavy fall of
snow, and the general thought it as well to billet out the
army in the villages, which are very thick in these parts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
There was no enemy in sight, and, as we had no tents, bivouacking
in the open would be neither pleasant nor safe.
We all enjoyed it vastly, particularly as the villages were
full of good things, oxen, and sheep, and wine, some of the
very best I ever tasted, and raisins, and vegetables of all
kinds. But after the first night we had an alarm. A great
army was reported in sight; and certainly there were
watchfires in every direction. The generals thereupon determined
to bring the army together again, and to bivouac
on the plain. The weather too, promised to be fine. But in
the night there was another heavy snow fall, so heavy that it
covered us all up. It was not uncomfortable lying there under
the snow; in fact, it felt quite warm; but of course it
was not safe. I have heard of people going to sleep under
such circumstances and not waking up again. Anyhow
Xenophon set the example of getting up, and setting to
work splitting wood. Before long we were all busy. But
there was no more bivouacking in the open. We went to
the villages again; and some foolish fellows who had wantonly
set their houses on fire were now punished for their
folly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">December 8.</span>&mdash;The weather becomes colder and colder,
and is our worst enemy now. The other day there was a
cutting north wind, which drifted the snow till it was more
than six feet deep in places. Xenophon, whose faith and
piety are admirable, suggested a sacrifice to the north wind.
This was made; and certainly the weather did begin to
abate shortly afterwards. The doubters say that the wind
always does go down after a time. These are matters on which
I do not pretend to judge; but I do see that Xenophon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>&rsquo;s
pious belief makes him very cheerful and courageous.
The day before yesterday many of our men were afflicted,
what with the long march and what with the cold, with a
sort of ravenous hunger. They fell down, and either would
not, or could not, move a step forward. At first we did not
know what was the matter with them; but then some one
who had campaigned before in cold countries suggested the
real cause. When we gave them a little food we found that
they recovered. Yesterday we nearly lost a number of men
who were simply overpowered with the cold. The enemy
was close behind, and we tried to raise the poor fellows up;
but they would not stir. &ldquo;Kill us,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but leave
us alone.&rdquo; They were simply stupid with cold. All that
could be done was to frighten the enemy away. On the
barbarians came, till the rear guard, who were lying in ambush,
dashed out upon them, and at the same time the sick
men shouted as loud as they could, and rattled their spears
against their shields. The enemy fled in a hurry, and we
saw and heard no more of them. But what would have
happened if they had persisted, is more than I can say. The
whole army was demoralized with the cold. The men lay
down as they could with their cloaks round them. There
was not a single guard placed anywhere. As it was, no
harm was done; and in the afternoon to-day the sick men
were brought safe into good quarters. We are now in excellent
quarters, with all that we could wish to eat and drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">December 9.</span>&mdash;Just as I had finished my entries yesterday
an Athenian with whom I have struck up a great
friendship asked me to come with him on an expedition.
His name is Polycrates, and he is the captain of a company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let us raid that village,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before the people have
time to get away.&rdquo; So we did, and we had a fine catch.
We laid hands on the villagers and their head man. With
the head man was his daughter who had been married only
eight days before. Her husband was out hare-hunting, and
so escaped. The village was a curious place. All the
houses were underground; beasts and men lived there together,
the beasts entering by a sloping way, the men by a
ladder. There were great stores of barley, and wheat, and
green stuff of all kinds. The drink was barley wine, which
they keep in great bowls. You have to suck it up by a reed.
It is very strong. As to the flavor I feel a little doubtful.
To-day Xenophon has been taking the head man, whom he
had to sup with him last night, all round the camp, by
which I mean the villages, for the men are encamped in
them. At Chirisophus&rsquo; quarters there was a strange sight.
The men were feasting with wisps of hay round their heads,
for lack of flowers; and Armenian boys, in the costume of
their country, were waiting on them. Everything of course
had to be explained by signs, for neither soldiers nor waiters
knew a word of each other&rsquo;s language. Xenophon gave the
head man his old charger, which indeed was pretty well
worn out with marching, and took for himself and his officers
a number of young horses which were going to be sent,
we were told, as part of the King&rsquo;s tribute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">December 27.</span>&mdash;Nothing of much moment has happened,
except it be a quarrel, the first that has taken place&mdash;and I
devoutly hope the last&mdash;between our generals. After resting
in the villages for a week, we started again, taking the
head man with us as a guide. If he did this duty properly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
he was to be allowed to depart and to take his son with him,
for he had a young son in his company. All the rest of his
family were safe in his own village with a very handsome
lot of presents. At the end of the third day Chirisophus
got into a great rage because the head man had not taken
them to any village. The man declared that there was no
village near. But Chirisophus would not listen, and
struck the man. The next night he ran away. Xenophon
was very angry. &ldquo;You ought not to have struck him,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;but having struck him, you certainly ought to have
kept a doubly strict guard on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">December 30.</span>&mdash;We have crossed the river Phasis, and got
through what is, I hope, our last difficult pass. I have not
time to write about it; but I must record an amusing little
controversy that took place between our two generals. It
shows anyhow that they have made up their quarrel.
Xenophon had been insisting that they must do as much as
they could by craft, and had been speaking of <i>stealing</i> somewhere
at night, <i>stealing</i> a march, and so forth. Then he
went on, &ldquo;But why do I talk about stealing in your presence
Chirisophus, for you Spartans are experts in the art.
You practice it, I am told, from your youth up. It is honorable
among you to take anything except what the law forbids.
But to encourage you and to make you master
thieves you get a whipping if you are found out. I must
not therefore presume to instruct you about <i>stealing</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo;
replied the other, &ldquo;you have the best possible right to do it.
You Athenians, I am told, are wonderfully clever
hands at stealing the public money and the best men
among you do it the most. No; we Spartans must yield to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
you.&rdquo; In the end the pass was carried without much loss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">January 3.</span>&mdash;For several days we have been on very
short commons. The Taochi, through whose country we
are passing, have collected all their possessions, alive and
dead, into strong places. At last we felt that something
had to be done, for we were simply starving. Accordingly,
when we came about noon to-day to one of these strongholds
which happened to lie directly on our route, Chirisophus
made up his mind to take it. It could be seen to be
full of flocks and herds besides a mixed crowd of men,
women and children. First one regiment went up against
it; then a second; then a third. They could do nothing
with it; the slingers and archers, which were the only
troops we could use, made no impression at all. Just then
Xenophon came up with the rear-guard, I being close behind
him. &ldquo;You have come just in the nick of time my
friend,&rdquo; said Chirisophus, &ldquo;we must take this place or
starve.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; Xenophon asked, &ldquo;is to hinder our
simply walking in?&rdquo; Chirisophus answered, &ldquo;You see that
one narrow path, that is the only way of approaching
the place. Whenever anyone attempts to go by it, these fellows
roll down huge masses of rock from the crag up there,&rdquo;
and he pointed to a cliff that overhung the plain. &ldquo;See
what has happened to some of my poor fellows who were
unlucky enough to get in the way!&rdquo; And sure enough there
was one man with one leg broken and another with both,
and a third with his ribs crushed in. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said my own
general, &ldquo;when these fellows have expended their ammunition&mdash;and
they can&rsquo;t have a perpetual supply of it&mdash;there
will be nothing else to hinder our going in. I can only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
see a very few men, and of these not more than two or three
are armed. As for the distance that we have to get across, it
cannot be more than one hundred and fifty yards; and two-thirds
of this are covered at intervals by great pine trees.
As long as we are among these, stones cannot hurt us.
These past, there are only fifty yards more to be crossed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Chirisophus, &ldquo;but the moment we get
near, the fire of stones begins again.&rdquo; &ldquo;All the better,&rdquo;
said Xenophon, &ldquo;the hotter their fire, the quicker the
enemy will use up their ammunition. However, let us
begin by picking out the place where the run across the open
space will be shortest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>First we occupied the trees. I had the luck, by special
favor of Xenophon, to be among them. We were only
seventy, for no more could find proper shelter behind the
pines. Then one of us came forward a yard or two from under
cover of the pines. No sooner did the Taochi see him than
they sent down a vast quantity of stones. Before they
reached him he was under cover again. This he did several
times; and every time a wagon-load of rocks, at the very
least, must have been whizzing and whistling down the
slope. Before long, however, the ammunition gave signs of
not holding out. As soon as Agasias, an Arcadian from
Lake Stymphalus, perceived this, he ran forward at full
speed. The man who had been amusing himself with the
rocks, caught hold of his shield as he ran by. Then two
other men started. Altogether it was a splendid race, and
curiously enough not another stone was thrown. Then the
rest of us followed. But when I saw the horrible thing that
ensued, I was inclined to be sorry that I had anything to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
do with it. The women threw their children over the cliff,
and then threw themselves after them, and the men did the
same. I caught hold of one man to stop him, but he wriggled
out of my grasp, and threw himself over the top. It
was well for me that he did so or else I might have fared as
&AElig;neas of Stymphalus did. He saw a man very finely
dressed just about to throw himself over, and tried to hold
him. The man did not try to get away, but clasped &AElig;neas
tightly in his arms. The next moment both had fallen
headlong over the edge. Of course they were both killed.
We took very few prisoners, but flocks and herds as many
as we wanted and more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">January 26.</span>&mdash;The marching has been easy enough on the
whole, though we have met with the bravest enemies that
we have yet come across, the Chalybes, they are called.
They did not hang on our rear, taking care never to fight
unless they had some vantage ground, but met us fairly
face to face. They were not as well armed as we. Indeed,
they had no armor on the body except cuirasses of linen.
Their chief weapon was a very long and clumsy spear.
Nevertheless they made a good fight of it; and if they did
kill a man they cut his head off directly with a short sabre
that they carried at their waists. We got nothing but hard
knocks here. All the property of the country was stored
away in strongholds; still what we got from the Taochi has
lasted us up to this time, and will supply us for some days
to come. The country of the Chalybes past, we came to the
city, the first, by the way, that we have seen. It seemed
very populous and rich, and its governor was extremely
civil. He gave us a guide who told us the best news that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
we had heard for a long time. &ldquo;Within five days you shall
see the sea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I fail, my life shall be the forfeit.&rdquo;
According to this we ought to see it to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">January 27.</span>&mdash;We have seen it! I was in the van-guard
as usual. We had our hands full, for the people of the
country were up in arms against us. Our friend, the guide,
had been very urgent with us to ravage and burn the
country; and the men had not been backward in following
his advice. So now there was a whole swarm of enemies
hanging on our heels, and we of the rear guard had to keep
them in check. All of a sudden we heard a tremendous uproar.
&ldquo;There is another attack on the van,&rdquo; cried Xenophon,
&ldquo;this looks serious.&rdquo; But the shouting grew louder
and nearer. As soon as a company came up, it began
racing towards the shouters, and then took to shouting
itself. Xenophon mounted his horse to see for himself what
had happened. He took the cavalry with him in case anything
should have happened, and I made the best of my way
after them. Presently we could distinguish the words.
The men were shouting, <i>The sea! The sea!</i> Then everybody
started running, rear guard and all; even the very
baggage horses were taken with it and came galloping up.
And, sure enough, there it was, right before our eyes, a
glimpse of blue in the distance with the sunshine upon it.
What a scene it was! We all fell to embracing one another;
rank was forgotten; generals, officers, and common men were
friends. Indeed the gods could not have given to our
eyes a more delightful sight. Presently the soldiers fell to
erecting a great cairn of stones. On this they put skins and
staves and wicker shields that we had taken from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
enemy. Of course the guide had a very handsome present
from the common store, a purse, a silver bowl, a Persian
dress, and ten gold pieces. Then he begged some rings,
and got not a few. The soldiers were ready to give him
anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 2.</span>&mdash;We have passed safely through another
country. The people were drawn out in order of battle
when the luckiest thing happened, saving, I doubt not,
many lives. One of the men came up to Xenophon and
said: &ldquo;I think I know the language these people talk. I
verily believe that it is my own.&rdquo; And so it turned out to
be. The man had been a slave in Athens. He explained
to them that we did not wish to do them any harm, but
simply wanted to get back to our own country. Since then
it has been peaceful. The people&mdash;Macrones they call
themselves&mdash;have been as helpful as possible, making roads
for us, and supplying us with as good food as they possessed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">February 7.</span>&mdash;Yesterday I really thought that after all
that I had gone through, I was going to die of eating a
mouthful of honey. We found a great store of this in one
of the Colchian villages that we came to, and of course ate
it freely. It was poisonous, at least to persons not used to
it. I know that I was desperately ill and so were many of
my comrades. Happily no one died. We reach Trapezus
to-morrow. We are in Greece again. Thanks be to Zeus
and all the gods!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>A THANKSGIVING.</small></h2>


<p>The worst severity of the winter was over when the army
reached Trapezus. The days were longer, for it was already
half way between the winter solstice and the spring equinox,
and though the nights were still bitterly cold, the sun was
daily gaining power. Sometimes a breeze from the west
gave to the air quite a feeling of spring. Still Callias was
very thankful to find quarters in the city. He discovered
but scarcely with surprise, that as soon as he returned within
the circle of Greek influence, the credentials furnished
him by Hippocles made life much smoother for him.
Trapezus was the very farthest outpost of civilization; it
was at least nine hundred miles from Athens, yet the name
of Hippocles seemed as well known and his credit as good as
if it had been the Piraeus itself. As soon as permission
could be obtained to enter the town&mdash;for the people of Trapezus,
though kind and even generous to the new arrivals,
kept their gates jealously shut&mdash;Callias made his way to the
house of a citizen who was, he was told, the principal merchant
in the place. Nothing could have been warmer than
the welcome which he received, when he produced the slip
of parchment to which Hippocles had affixed his seal and
signature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All I have is at your disposal,&rdquo; cried Demochares; this
was the name of the Trapezuntine merchant. &ldquo;I cannot
do too much for any friend of Hippocles. You will, of
course, take up your quarters with me; and any advance
that you may want,&mdash;unless,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;you
have learnt extravagance among the Persians, for we are
not very rich here in Trapezus&mdash;any advance within reason
you have only to ask for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young Athenian ventured to borrow fifty gold pieces,
astonishing his new friend by the moderation of his demand.
He knew that some of his comrades, mercenaries who had
not received an <i>obolus</i> of pay for several months, must be
very badly off, and he was glad to make a slight return for
many little services that he had received, and acts of kindness
and good fellowship that had been done for him on the
march. As for hospitality, he begged to be allowed to postpone
his answer till he could consult his general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave you, sir,&rdquo; he said when he broached
the subject to Xenophon after their evening meal. &ldquo;Why
should I have the comforts of a house, lie soft, and feed well,
while you are sleeping on the ground, and getting or not
getting a meal, as good luck or bad luck will have it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; replied Xenophon, &ldquo;there is no reason
why you should not take the good the gods provide you.
You are not one of us; you never have been. You came as
a volunteer, and a volunteer you have remained. You are
perfectly free to do as you please. Besides, if you want anything
more to satisfy you, you are attached to my command,
and I formally give you leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias, accordingly, took up his quarters in the merchant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>&rsquo;s
house. Never was guest more handsomely treated. Demochares
and his family were never wearied of his adventures,
a story which has indeed interested the world ever since,
and which to these Greeks of Trapezus had a meaning
which it had lost for us. Living as they did on the farthest
boundaries of the Greater Greece, the Greece of the colonies,
they were keenly alive to all that could be known about the
barbarian world with which they were brought in constant
contact. The young Athenian, indeed, held a sort of levee
which was thronged day after day with visitors young and
old. All that he had to tell them about the Great King, on
whose dominions they were in some sort trespassers, and
about the unknown tribes who dwelt between the sea and
the Persian capital, was eagerly listened to. Pleasant as his
sojourn was to himself, it was not without some advantage
to his old comrades. His host was an important person in
Trapezus, holding indeed the chief magistracy for the year,
and he had much to do with the liberal present of oxen,
corn, and wine which the town voted to the army.</p>

<p>A month passed in a sufficiently pleasant way. Meanwhile
the army was preparing to offer a solemn thanksgiving
for the safe completion of the most perilous part of
its journey. The vows made at the moment of its greatest
danger were now to be paid, and paid, after the usual Greek
fashion, in a way that would combine religion and festivity.
There was to be a sacrifice; the sacrifice was to be followed
by a feast, and the feast again by a celebration which was,
of course, in a great measure an entertainment, but was also,
in a way, a function of worship. Wrestlers, boxers, and
runners not only amused the spectators and contended for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
glory and prizes, but were also supposed in some way to be
doing honor to the gods.</p>

<p>The sacrifice and the feast it is not necessary to describe.
Necessarily there was nothing very splendid or costly about
them. The purses of the soldiers were empty, though they
had a good deal of property, chiefly in the way of prisoners
whom they had captured on the way, and whom they would
sell in the slave markets as the opportunity might come.
Trapezus, however, and the friendly Colchian tribes in the
neighborhood furnished a fair supply of sheep and oxen to
serve as victims, and a sufficient quantity of bread, wine,
dried fruit and olive oil, this last being a luxury which the
Greeks had greatly missed during their march, and which
they highly appreciated. A few of the officers, the pious
Xenophon among them, went to the expense of gilding the
horns of the beasts which were their special offerings; but
for the most part the arrangements were of a plain and frugal
kind.</p>

<p>The games had at least the merit of affording a vast amount
of entertainment to a huge multitude of spectators. They
were celebrated, it may be easily understood, under considerable
difficulties, for Trapezus did not possess any regular
race course, and the only rings for wrestling and boxing
were within the walls, and therefore not available on this
occasion. By common consent the management of the
affair was handed over to a certain Dracontius. He was a
Spartan, and to the Spartans, who had been undisputed
lords of Greece since the fall of Athens, had been conceded
a certain right of precedence on all such occasions as these.
Dracontius, too, was a man of superior rank to his comrades.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
He belonged to one of the two royal houses of Sparta, but
had been banished from his country in consequence of an
unlucky accident. In one of the rough sports which the
Spartan lads were accustomed to practice, sports which were
commonly a more or less close mimicry of war, a blow of his
dagger, dealt without evil intention but with a criminal
carelessness, had been fatal to a companion. Hence, from
boyhood, he had been an exile; cut off from the more
honorable career to which he might have looked forward
in the service of his country, he had been content to enlist
as a mercenary.</p>

<p>Dracontius, accordingly, was made president of the games.
The skins of the sacrificed animals were presented to him,
as his fee, and he was asked to lead the way to the racecourse
where the contests were to be held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Race course!&rdquo; cried the Spartan, with the <i>brusquerie</i>
which it was the fashion of his country to use, &ldquo;Race course!
What more do you want than what we have here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of astonishment ran through the army. Indeed
there could have been nothing less like a race course
than the ground on which they were standing. It was the
slope of a hill, a slope that sometimes became almost precipitous.
Most of it was covered with brushwood and heather.
Grass there was none, except here and there where it covered
with a treacherously smooth surface some dangerous quagmire.
Here and there, the limestone rock cropped up with
jagged points.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where shall we wrestle?&rdquo; asked Timagenes, an Arcadian
athlete, who had won the prize for wrestling two or
three years before at the Lithurian games, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
naturally considered himself as an authority on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here of course,&rdquo; was the president&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can a man wrestle on ground so hard and so
rough?&rdquo; asked the Arcadian, who had no idea of practising
his art except in a regular ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well enough,&rdquo; said Dracontius, &ldquo;but those who are
thrown will get worse knocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wrestler&rsquo;s face fell and he walked off amid a general
laugh. His comrades fancied, not without reason, that he
was a great deal too careful of his person.</p>

<p>But if the ground, broken with rocks and overgrown with
wood was not suited to scientific wrestling, it certainly
helped to make some of the other sports more than usually
amusing. The first contest was a mile race for boys. Most
of the competitors were lads who had been taken prisoners
on the march, but a few Colchians entered for the prize, as
did also two or three boys of Trapezus, who had the reputation
of being particularly fleet of foot. But the natives of
the plain, still more the inhabitants of the town, found
themselves entirely outpaced on this novel race course by
the young mountaineers. A Carduchian came in first, and
was presented with his liberty, his master being compensated
out of the prize fund which had been subscribed by
the army. As soon as he understood that he was free, he
set out at full speed in the direction of his home. A true
mountaineer, he sickened for his native hills, and in the
hope of seeing them again was ready to brave alone the
perils which an army had scarcely survived.</p>

<p>A foot race for men followed, but the distance to be traversed
was, according to the common custom of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
games, only two hundred yards. There were as many as
sixty competitors; but curiously enough, they were to a man
Cretans. Another foot race, this time for men in heavy
armor, was next run. The president had a Spartan&rsquo;s admiration
for all exercises that had a real bearing on military
training, and the race of the heavy armed was unquestionably
one of these. It was won by a gigantic Arcadian, an
&AElig;tolian whose diminutive stature made a curious contrast
to his competitor, coming in close behind him.</p>

<p>Next came the great event of the day, the &ldquo;Contest of the
Five Exercises,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pentathlon.&rdquo; The five were leaping,
wrestling, running, quoit-throwing, and javelin-throwing.
The competitor who won most successes had the prize adjudged
to him.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Callias had been trained for some time at
home with the intention of becoming a competitor at Olympia;
but various causes had hindered him from carrying out
his purpose, and, of course, he was now wholly out of practice.
He was sitting quietly among the spectators when he
felt a hand upon his shoulder and looking up, saw his
general standing by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand up for the honor of Athens,&rdquo; said Xenophon,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t let the men of the Island<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> carry everything before
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not in training,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in as good training, I fancy,&rdquo; replied the general,
&ldquo;as are any of these; better I should say, to judge from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
way in which they have been eating and drinking since the
retreat was ended. Besides, it is only the boxers who absolutely
require anything very severe in that way. And you
have youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias still made objections, but yielded when his general
made the matter a personal favor.</p>

<p>The competitors were five in number, the winner of the
foot-race, the tall Arcadian and his diminutive rival from
&AElig;tolia, two Achaeans, and Callias.</p>

<p>The first contest was leaping at the bar. Here the Arcadian&rsquo;s
long legs served him well. He was a singularly ungainly
fellow, and threw himself over the bar, if I may be
allowed the expression, in a lump. Every time the bar was
raised, he managed just to clear it, though the spectators
could not understand how his clumsy legs, which seemed
sprawling everywhere, managed to avoid touching it. Still
they did manage it, and when he had cleared four cubits
short of a palm, which may be translated into the English
measure of five feet nine inches, his rivals had to own themselves
beaten. Callias, who came second, declared that he
had been balked by the infamous playing of the flute player,
whose music according to the custom followed at Olympia,
accompanied the jumping. &ldquo;The wretch,&rdquo; he declared to
the friends who condoled with him on the loss of what they
had put down to him for a certainty, &ldquo;the wretch played
a false note just as I was at my last trial. If I had not heard
him do the same at least half-a-dozen times before, I should
have said that he did it on purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If chance or fraud had been against him in this trial, in
the next he was decidedly favored by fortune. This was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the foot race. The course was, as usual, round a post fixed
about a hundred yards from the starting point, and home
again. Whenever a turn has to be made, a certain advantage
falls to the competitor who has the inner place, and
when, as in this case, the distance is short, the advantage is
considerable. The places were determined by lot. The innermost
fell to the Arcadian; Callias came next to him;
fortunately for him, his most dangerous competitor, the
Cretan who had won the foot race, had the outermost, <i>i. e.</i>,
the worst station. The Arcadian jumped away with a lead,
and for fifty yards managed, thanks to the long strides
which his long legs enabled him to take, to keep in front; but
the effort was soon spent; by the time that the turning
point was reached, Callias had gained enough upon him to
attempt the dangerous man&#339;uvre of taking his ground. If
it had not been for this, he must have been beaten, for the
fleet-footed Cretan, weighted though he was by his disadvantageous
place, ran a dead heat with him.</p>

<p>In the quoit-throwing, the Arcadian&rsquo;s strength and
stature brought him to the front again. With us quoit-playing
is a trial of skill as well as of strength. The quoit
is thrown at a mark, and the player who contrives to go
nearest to this mark, without touching it (for to touch it
commonly ends in disaster) wins. At the same time the
throw does not count unless the quoit either sticks into the
ground or lies flat upon it with the right side uppermost. In
the Greek game there were no requirements of this kind.
The quoit was a huge mass of metal with notches by which
it could be conveniently grasped, or, sometimes, a hole in
the middle through which a leather strap or wooden handle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
could be put. He who threw it farthest was the winner.
Some little knack was required, as is indeed the case in every
feat of strength, and, as has been said before, stature was
the chief qualification. The Arcadian hurled the quoit, a
mass of iron weighing ten pounds, to the vast distance of
forty-two feet. None of his rivals came near him. As he
had now won two events out of three, and his gigantic
height and weight would make him, to say the least, a formidable
opponent in the wrestling, he was a favorite for
the prize. His Arcadian countrymen, who formed, as has
been said, a large proportion of the army, were in high hope,
and staked sums that were far beyond their means on his
success.</p>

<p>The quoit-throwing was followed by hurling the javelin
at a mark. Here the Arcadian was hopelessly distanced,
for here skill was as much wanted as strength had been in
the preceding trial. He threw the javelin indeed with prodigious
force, but threw it wholly wide of the mark. Indeed,
when he was performing, the near neighborhood of the
mark would have been the safest place to stand. The spectators
were more than once in danger of their lives, so at random
and at the same time so vigorous were his strokes. The
first mark was a post rudely fashioned into the figure of a
man. To hit the head was the best aim that could be made;
to hit a space marked out upon the body and roughly representing
the heart was the next; the third in merit was a
blow that fell on some other part of the body. The legs
counted for nothing. Callias and the Cretan scored precisely
the same. The Athenian hit the head twice, scoring six for
the two blows. The third time his javelin missed altogether.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
The Cretan, on the other hand, in his three strokes hit the
third, second, and the first places successively, scoring for
them one, two, and three respectively. Further trials of
skill were now given. A wand about three fingers wide was
set up at a distance of twelve yards. The Cretan&rsquo;s javelin
pierced it, making it, as may be supposed, an exceedingly
difficult thing for a rival to equal, much more to surpass the
performance. But Callias was equal to the occasion. Amid
tumultuous applause from the spectators, for his courtesy
and carriage had made him a great favorite, he hurled his
javelin with such accuracy that he split that which was
already sticking in the mark. Again the Cretan and he
were pronounced to have made a tie.</p>

<p>The two Achaeans and the &AElig;tolian did creditably, scoring
five each. As they had failed in four out of the five
contests, the prize was clearly out of their reach, and they
stood out of the last competition, the wrestling.</p>

<p>And now came the last and deciding struggle. Here
again fortune decidedly favored the Athenian. The president,
following the rule always observed at Olympia, ordered
three lots marked A, B, and C, and representing respectively
Callias, the Arcadian, and the Cretan, to be put into an urn.
The two first drawn were to contend in the first heat, the
third was to have what is technically called a &ldquo;bye.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;bye&rdquo; fell to the lot of Callias, and with it, it need hardly
be said, the not inconsiderable advantage of coming fresh to
contend with a rival who had undergone the fatigue of a
previous struggle.</p>

<p>The issue of the contest between the Arcadian and the
Cretan was not long in doubt. The latter was an agile fellow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
who would have had a very good chance with &ldquo;light-weights,&rdquo;
to use again a technical term, if the competitors
had been so classed, as indeed they are by the customs of the
modern wrestling ring. But against his gigantic opponent
he had scarcely a chance. In the first bout the Arcadian
lifted his antagonist clean from the ground, and threw him
down at full length without more ado. The second was
more equal. The Cretan struck his antagonist&rsquo;s left ankle
so sharply with his foot that the giant fell, but he could
not loose the other&rsquo;s hold, and fell also, scoring only the advantage
of being the uppermost. If there had been a tie in
the other two bouts this might have sufficed to give him the
victory, or the president might have ordered a fresh trial.
But the third bout was decisive. It was in fact a repetition
of the first, only, if possible, still more decisive. The Cretan
was again lifted from the ground, before he had the chance
of practising any of his devices, and again hurled at full
length upon the ground. This time he was stunned, and
carried insensible from the ground by his companions.</p>

<p>A brief interval was now allowed. It was thought unfair
that the Arcadian should be called upon to engage a fresh
antagonist without some chance of resting himself. But
what was meant for an advantage turned out to be exactly
the contrary. The man was not particularly tired, but he
was exceedingly thirsty, and he had not learnt the habit of
self-control. Regardless of the remonstrance of his companions,
he indulged himself with a huge goblet of wine
and water. So imprudent was he indeed that he put less
water than was usual in the mixture, and slightly confused
his brain by the potency of the draught. When he came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
forth to meet his antagonist, he had not only damaged his
wind but had made his footing somewhat unsteady. Three
bouts, as before, were fought. The Arcadian first tried the
simple tactics which had been successful with the Cretan.
He did his best to lift the Athenian from the ground, and
Callias had all he could do to prevent it. But his weight
and his strength, which he made the most of by his coolness,
stood him in good stead. After a fierce struggle both fell
together, and fell in such a way that the president declared
that neither had gained any advantage. Practically, however,
the victory was decided in favor of Callias. The Arcadian&rsquo;s
strength was impaired, and he was so scant of
breath that he could not use what was left to him. And he
had little skill to fall back upon, whereas his antagonist had
been the favorite pupil of one of the best trainers in Athens.
In the second bout Callias struck the Arcadian on the right
foot with his own left; in the third he simply reversed the
device, striking the left with his right. In both he contrived
to free himself when his opponent fell. Thus the
fifth contest ended for him in an unquestioned victory.</p>

<p>The prize of victory was an ox and a purse of twenty-five
gold pieces, for soldiers who fought for pay would not have
relished the barren honor of a wreath of wild olive with
which the Olympian judges were accustomed to reward the
victors. Callias won golden opinions from his comrades by
the liberality with which he disposed of his gains. The ox
he presented to the company to which he had been attached;
the money he divided, in such proportion as seemed right,
among the unsuccessful competitors.</p>

<p>One more contest remained, and it turned out to be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
most entertaining of them all. This was a horse race. The
competitors were to make their way from the hill-top to the
shore and back again. The headlong, break-neck speed at
which they galloped down, and the slow and painful effort
by which they crawled back again, were witnessed with inextinguishable
laughter by the assembled crowds. Xenophon
himself took a part in this sport, and gained great
favor not only by his condescension but by his skillful
riding. He did not win indeed, for the animal which he
rode was hopelessly inferior, but his performance did not
discredit the land which claimed by the bounty of the god
of the sea to have been the birthplace of the horse.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The
piety of Xenophon always ready to show itself, did not fail
to improve the occasion of his young friend&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have gained the prize,&rdquo; he said in a tone of the
deepest earnestness, &ldquo;nor did you fail to deserve it. Prize
it the more because it is manifest that the gods favor you.
Youth and strength pass away, but piety you can cherish
always, and cherishing piety, you have also the favor of
the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>BUSINESS AND PLEASURE.</small></h2>


<p>Its religious obligations discharged, for the games, as has
been already said, were regarded as a service of thanksgiving
for deliverance, the army turned its attention to secular
affairs. One indispensable duty, one curiously characteristic,
by the way, of the Greek soldier&rsquo;s temper of mind, was to
call the generals to account. For a Greek soldier, even when
he was selling his sword to the highest bidder, never forgot
that he was a citizen, and that as a citizen he had the right
of satisfying himself that his superiors had done their duty
with due care and with integrity. The Ten Thousand
accordingly put aside for the time their military character,
and resolved themselves into a civil assembly. Their generals
were no longer the commanding officers to whom they owed
an unhesitating obedience, but the magistrates who had just
completed their term of office, and had now to render their
accounts<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> to those who had elected them.</p>

<p>The meeting of the army, perhaps I should rather say the
assembly, was held on the same ground which had served<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
for a race course. One by one the officers were called to
answer for themselves. With many, indeed, the proceeding
was purely formal. The name was called, and the man
stepped forward on a platform which had been erected
where it could be best seen by the whole meeting. If no
one appeared to make a complaint or to ask a question, the
soldiers gave him a round of applause, if I may use the word
of the noise made by clashing their spears against their
shields; this was a verdict of acquittal and the officer retired
with a bow. And this was what commonly happened.
After all, the leaders had, on the whole, done their duty
sufficiently well; there was proof of that in the simple fact
that such a meeting was being held. But all did not escape
so easily. If, indeed, only a few voices of dissatisfaction were
heard, the matter was not pushed any further. When the
second appeal was made by the malcontents, they, seeing
that they were not supported by their comrades, preferred
to keep silence. The man would, in all probability, be their
officer again and he would not be likely to think pleasantly
of any one who had accused him. But where, on the other
hand, there was anything like an agreement of dissatisfied
voices, the complainants took courage to come forward, and
the examination was proceeded with in earnest. One officer
had had charge of some of the property of the army; there
was a deficiency in his accounts and he was fined twenty
himal<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> to make it good. Another was accused of carelessness
in his duties as leader, and had to pay half this sum.
Then came the <i>cause celebre</i>, as it may be called, of the day,
the trial of Xenophon himself. Xenophon was generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
popular with the army, as, indeed, he could scarcely fail to
be, considering all that he had done for it; but he had
enemies. The mere fact of his being an Athenian made him
an object of dislike to some; others, as will be seen, he had
been compelled to offend in the discharge of his duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Xenophon, the son of Gryllus,&rdquo; shouted the herald at
the top of his voice.</p>

<p>The Athenian stepped on to the platform.</p>

<p>An Arcadian soldier, Nicharchus by name, came forward
and said, &ldquo;I accuse Xenophon the Athenian of violence
and outrage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few voices of assent were heard throughout the meeting;
and some half dozen men came forward to support the
the prosecutor. Accuser and accused were now confronted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what do you accuse me?&rdquo; asked Xenophon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of wantonly striking me,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When and where did you suffer these blows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we had crossed the Euphrates, when there was a
heavy fall of snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember. You are right. The weather was terrible;
our provisions had run out; the wine could not so much as
be smelt; many men were dropping down, half dead with
fatigue; the enemy were close upon our heels. Were not
these things so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true. Things were as bad as you say, or even worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; said Xenophon, turning to the assembly,
&ldquo;how we were situated, and indeed, seeing that you suffered
these things yourself, you are not likely to forget them.
Verily; if in such a condition of things, I struck this man
wantonly and without cause, you might fairly count me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
more brutal than an ass. But say&mdash;&rdquo; he went on, addressing
himself again to his accuser, &ldquo;was there not a cause for
my beating you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was a cause,&rdquo; the fellow sullenly admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I ask you for something, and strike you because you
refused to give it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I demand payment for a debt, and lose my temper
because the money was not forthcoming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was I drunken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me now; are you a heavy-armed soldier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a light-armed then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; nor yet a light-armed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was driving a mule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being a slave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so; I am free; but my commander compelled me
to drive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A light broke in upon Xenophon. He had had a general
recollection of the occasion, but could not remember the
particular incident. Now it all came back to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I remember; it was you who were
carrying the sick man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man confessed, &ldquo;I did so, by your compulsion;
and a pretty mess was made of the kit that I had upon the
mule&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, not so; the men carried the things themselves, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
nothing was lost. But hear the rest of the story,&rdquo; he went
on, turning to the assembly, &ldquo;and, indeed it is worth hearing.
I found a poor fellow lying upon the ground, who
could not move a step further. I knew the man, and knew
him as one who had done good service. And I compelled
you, sir,&rdquo; addressing Nicharchus, &ldquo;to carry him. For if I
mistake not, the enemy were close behind us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Arcadian nodded assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then; I sent you forward with your burden,
and after a while, overtook you again, when I came up with
the rear-guard. You were digging a trench in which to
bury the man. I thought it a pious act, and praised you
for it. But, lo! while I was speaking, the dead man, as I
thought he was, twitched his leg. &lsquo;Why he&rsquo;s alive,&rsquo; the
bystanders cried out. &lsquo;Alive or dead, as he pleases,&rsquo; you
said, &lsquo;but I am not going to carry him any further.&rsquo; Then
I struck you. I acknowledge it. It seemed to me that you
were going to bury the poor fellow alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Arcadian, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t deny, I suppose,
that the man died after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Xenophon, &ldquo;he died, I acknowledge. We
must all die some day; but, meanwhile, there is no reason
why we should be buried alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man hung his head and said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What say you, comrades?&rdquo; cried Xenophon.</p>

<p>One of the oldest men in the ranks got up and said, &ldquo;If
Xenophon had given the scoundrel a few more blows he had
done well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A deafening clash of swords and spears followed, and the
verdict was accepted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>The other complainants were now called to state the particulars
of their grievances. Dismayed by the reception
which their spokesman had met with, they remained silent,
one and all. Xenophon then entered upon a general defence
of his conduct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I confess that I have many times
struck men for want of discipline. These were men who,
leaving others to provide for their safety, thought only of
their own gain. While we were fighting they would leave
their place in the ranks to plunder, and so enriched themselves
at our expense. Some also I have struck, when I
found them playing the coward and ready to give themselves
helplessly up to the enemy. Then I forced them to
march on, and so saved their lives. For I know, having
once myself sat down in a sharp frost, while I was waiting
for my comrades, how loath one is to rise again. Therefore,
for their sake, I raised them even with blows, as I should myself
wish, were I so found, to be raised. Others also have I
struck whom I found straggling behind that they might
rest. I struck them for your sake, for they were hindering
both you that were in front, and us that were behind, and I
struck them for their own sake. For verily it was a lighter
thing to have a blow with the fist from me than a spear&rsquo;s
thrust from the enemy. Of a truth, if they are able to stand
up now to accuse me, it is because I saved them thus. Had
they fallen into the enemy&rsquo;s hand, what satisfaction would
they be able to get, even if their wrongs were ten times
worse than that Nicharchus complains of? No,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;my friends, I have done nothing more to any one than
what a wise father does to his child, or a good physician<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
does to his patient. You see how I behave myself now. I
am in better case; I fare better; I have food and wine in
plenty. Yet I strike no one. Why? Because there is no
need; because we have weathered the storm, and are in
smooth water. I need no more defence; you have, I see,
acquitted me. Yet I cannot forbear to say that I take it ill
that this accusation has been made. You remember the
times when I had for your good to incur your dislike; but
the times when I eased the burden of storm or winter for
any of you, when I beat off an enemy, when I ministered to
you in sickness or in want, these no one remembers&mdash;&rdquo; and
here the speaker&rsquo;s voice half broke, partly with real emotion,
partly at the suggestion of the orator&rsquo;s art. A thrill of
sympathy ran through the audience. &ldquo;And you forget,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;that I never failed to praise the doer of any
noble deed, or to do such honor as I could, to the brave, living
or dead. Yet, surely it were more noble, more just, more
after the mind of the gods, a sweeter and kindlier act, to
treasure the memory of the good than to cherish these hateful
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the speaker sat down, there was nothing that he
might not have obtained from his comrades.</p>

<p>That night there was a great banquet. This served a
double purpose. Quarrels were made up, and some other
difficult relations of the army to its neighbors were satisfactorily
adjusted. The fact was, that the Greeks, partly
from their want, and partly in the hope of filling their
pockets after a long and profitless campaign, had been
plundering right and left. The natives, on the other hand,
had not been slow to retaliate. Plundering cannot be done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
satisfactorily in company; but any who ventured to do a
little business on his own account ran a great chance of being
cut off. Under these circumstances both parties thought
it might be possible to come to an agreement. If the Greeks
would not plunder, the natives would leave them unmolested
and even furnish them with supplies. The chief of the
country, accordingly, sent an embassy, with a handsome
present of horses and robes of native manufacture. The
generals entertained them at a banquet, to which, at the
same time, they invited the most influential men of the
army. The chief&rsquo;s proposals would be informally discussed,
and proposed in regular form at a general meeting the next
day.</p>

<p>The generals did their best to impress their guests. Meat,
bread and wine were in plenty; and the eparch of Trapezus
sent one of the magnificent turbots for which the waters
of the Black Sea were famous. All the plate that was in
the camp was put into requisition to make as brave a show
as possible; and, at the instance of Callias, some handsome
vessels of gold and silver were lent by the town authorities.</p>

<p>But, in the eyes of the guests, the most impressive part of
the entertainment was in the performances which followed
it. The libation having been made and the hymn, which supplied
the part of grace after meat, having been sung, some
of the Thracian soldiers came upon the platform which had
been prepared for the performers. They wore the usual
armor of their country, a helmet, greaves, light cuirass, and
sword, and danced a national dance to the sound of a flute,
leaping into the air with extraordinary nimbleness, and
brandishing their swords. One pair of dancers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
conspicuous for their agility. Faster and faster grew their
movements, and with gestures of defiance they alternately
retreated and advanced. At last, one of them, carried, it
seemed, out of himself by his rage, thrust at his fellow with
his sword. The man fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is killed!&rdquo; screamed out the guests, and rose from
their seats.</p>

<p>Indeed, the man had fallen so artistically and lay so still
that any one would have thought that he had received a
fatal blow. The Greeks, however, looked on unmoved, and
the strangers, not knowing whether this wonderful people
might not be wont to kill each other for the entertainment
of their guests, resumed their seats. The dancer who had
dealt the blow stripped the other of his arms, and hurried
off, singing the Thracian national song:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;All praise to Sitalces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Invisible Lord,</span><br />
The spear point that errs not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The death-dealing sword,</span><br />
The chariot that scatters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The close ranks of war,</span><br />
Red Ruin behind it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Blind Panic before!&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>When he had left the stage a party of Thracians appeared
and carried off the fallen man, who had remained without
giving the slightest sign of life.</p>

<p>Another dance in armor succeeded, performed this time
by &AElig;olian tribesmen from the Menalian coast. A man
came on the stage, and, laying aside his arms, made believe
to drive a yoke of oxen, and to sow as he drove. Every now
and then he looked round, with an admirable imitation of
expecting some unpleasant interruption. This came in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
shape of another armed man, who was supposed to represent
a cattle-lifter. The ploughman caught up his arms, and ran
to encounter him. The two fought in front of the team,
keeping time as they struck and parried to the sound of the
flute. At last the robber appeared to vanquish his adversary,
to bind him, strip him of his arms, and drive off the
team.</p>

<p>The next performer was a Mysian, who danced, again in
armor, what we should call a <i>pas seul</i>. He had a light
shield in each hand, and seemed to be fighting with two adversaries
at once; his action was extraordinarily life-like
and his agility almost more than human. In curious contrast
with his performance was the stately movement of
some Arcadians heavy-armed, who, with all the weight of
their armor and accoutrements upon them, moved to the
tune of the warriors&rsquo; march with as much ease as if they
had been perfectly unencumbered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; cried one of the envoys to his next
neighbor, &ldquo;what men these are! Their armor seems not one
whit heavier to them than a shirt, and they carry their
swords and their spears as if they were twigs of osier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the Mysians, whose dialect was not very different
from that of the speaker, overheard the remark. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
he said to himself, &ldquo;we will astonish these gentlemen still
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew one of the Arcadians who had just performed,
aside. &ldquo;Send Cleone on the stage,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Cleone was a dancing-girl, famous for her agility.</p>

<p>By good luck she was at hand, having indeed expected
to perform for the amusement of the company. The Arca<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>dian
made her put on a light cuirass of silvered steel, which
she wore over a scarlet tunic. She had a short gilded helmet,
buskins of purple, and sandals tied with crimson strings.
In her left hand she carried a small shield, and in her right,
a light spear. Thus accoutred, she came on the stage and
danced the Pyrrhic dance with tremendous applause from
all the spectators.</p>

<p>The astonishment of the native guests was beyond all expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried their chief, &ldquo;do your women fight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the General whom he addressed, &ldquo;of
course they fight, and very pretty soldiers they make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women soldiers!&rdquo; gasped the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said his host, &ldquo;did you not know that it was the
women who routed the Great King, and drove him out of
our camp?&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>INVALIDED.</small></h2>


<p>Callias found it very hard to sit out the banquet and
the entertainment that followed it. He had felt a headache
before sitting, or to speak more correctly, lying down, and
this grew so bad during the evening that he gladly took the
earliest opportunity of leaving. The fact was that he had
been ailing for some days; the excitement of the games had
carried him through the labors of the day, but he suffered
doubly from the reaction, and before nightfall he was
seriously ill.</p>

<p>And now he found the advantage of having followed
Xenophon&rsquo;s advice and taken up his quarters in the town.
Had he been reduced to such nursing and attendance as the
camp could have supplied, his chances of moving would
have been small indeed. At the house of Demochares, on
the contrary, he had everything in his favor, an exceptionally
good nurse, and an exceptionally skillful physician. In
those days neither branch of the healing art, for nursing
has certainly as much to do with healing as physicking,
was very successfully cultivated. Women nursed the sick,
indeed, often with kindness and devotion, for woman&rsquo;s
nature was substantially the same then as it is now, but
they did it in a blind and ignorant fashion. As for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
practice of medicine it was a mass of curious superstitions
and prejudices, leavened here and there with a few grains
of experience, and, if the practitioner happened to have that
inestimable quality, of good sense. Of systems there was
only the beginning. The great physician Hippocrates had
indeed acquired a vast reputation, and was beginning to influence
the opinion of the faculty throughout Greece; but
the medical profession has always been slow to adopt new
ideas&mdash;what profession, indeed, has not?&mdash;the means of
communication, too, were very limited, and as yet his teaching
had had but little effect.</p>

<p>But Callias happened to be exceedingly fortunate both in
his nurse and in his doctor. The house of Demochares was
kept by his sister, a widow, who after her husband&rsquo;s death
had returned to her old home, and had devoted herself to a
life of kindness and charity. The young Athenian had won
her heart, not only by his sunny temper and gracious manners,
but by his resemblance to a son of her own whose
early death&mdash;he had been slain in a skirmish with the barbarian
neighbors of Trapezus&mdash;had been the second great
sorrow of her life. His illness called forth her tenderest
sympathies, and nothing could have exceeded the devotion
with which she ministered to her patient.</p>

<p>The physician, Demoleon by name, was a very remarkable
man. He was a native of the island of Cos, and was at
this time between fifty and sixty years of age. He had been
one of the first pupils of the famous Hippocrates, who was
a native of the same island, and had lived on terms of great
intimacy with his teacher whom he assisted in his
private practice. When Hippocrates was summoned to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
plague-stricken city of Athens, Demoleon accompanied him,
and, by a curious coincidence, in the course of his residence
there had treated the father of Callias. Whatever the benefit
that followed the prescriptions of Hippocrates, it is certain
that the fact of his being called in to administer them by the
most famous citizen of Greece, largely increased his reputation,
and that even beyond the border of Greece. The great
physician&rsquo;s return from Athens was speedily followed by an
invitation from Artaxerxes, King of Persia.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The plague
that had devastated Greece had passed eastward, and was
committing destructive ravages throughout the Persian
Empire. Artaxerxes implored Hippocrates to give him and
his subjects the benefit of his advice. He offered at the
same time the magnificent <i>honorarium</i> of two talents of
gold yearly.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The patriotism or the prudence of Hippocrates
led him to refuse this offer, tempting as it was. He would
not, he said, and doubtless with sincerity, give the benefit
of his advice to the hereditary enemy of his country. At
the same time, we may suppose, he reflected to himself that
he would be putting himself, without any possibility of appeal,
at the mercy of a tyrannical and unscrupulous master.
But one of the Persian envoys succeeded in doing a little
business of the same kind on his own account. He found
the pupil less resolute against the temptations of a great
bribe than the master had been. Accordingly he engaged
Demoleon to come in the capacity of physician to himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and his household. The King would have the opportunity
of availing himself of his advice if he pleased. Artaxerxes
was disappointed at the refusal of Hippocrates, but he did
not disdain the help of a man who had shared his practice,
and was probably acquainted with his system. Demoleon
prescribed at Susa and Persepolis the remedies which his
master had employed at Athens, the burning of huge fires
in the street and squares, and the use of an antidote. The
pestilence either yielded to these influences, or, as is more
probable, had exhausted its force. At any rate Demoleon got
the credit of having vanquished the enemy, and was rewarded
by a munificent present from the King and by an
enormous practice.</p>

<p>He might have accumulated great wealth but for
an unlucky complication for which he can scarcely
be considered to have been to blame. Necessity sometimes
compelled a departure, in the case of the physician,
from the strict rules of seclusion with which the Persian
women were surrounded. Demoleon was called in to
visit the daughter of a Persian noble. She was a beautiful
girl, or rather would have been beautiful but for the fact
that she was blind. It was a case of cataract, and the Greek
physician, who was as bold as he was skillful, ventured on
an operation which at that time had scarcely been attempted,
or even thought of. It proved entirely successful. The
gratitude of the father was shown by a munificent present
of gold and jewels; that of the daughter by the gift of her
heart. One of the very first objects on which her eyes
rested when the bandage was permitted to be removed was
the form of the young physician who had restored to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
one of the greatest joys of life. Under any circumstances
it was likely to please her; and Demoleon was in the bloom
of early manhood, and his fair complexion and golden hair
showed in attractive contrast to the swarthy hues of her
countrymen. The result was that she fell deeply in love.
Demoleon was not without prudence, and would have
hesitated to listen to any promptings of his own heart, for
he too had been greatly impressed by the beauty and grace
as well as by the pathetic patience of the sufferer. Amestris&mdash;that
was the young lady&rsquo;s name&mdash;guessed readily
enough that the physician would not venture to speak, and
she took the matter into her own hands. She did not speak
herself; for that, passionate as was her affection, would have
been impossible; but she got some one to speak for her.
Her nurse&mdash;the nurse was generally the <i>confidante</i> of antiquity&mdash;undertook
the task of communicating with the
young man. One day she gave him a pomegranate, saying
at the same time that he would find the fruit especially
sweet. Her words would have seemed ordinary enough to
any one that might have happened to hear them; but the
young physician, whose feelings made him susceptible,
suspected, he could not say why, a particular meaning.
Opening the fruit he found a ring engraved with a single
Greek word&mdash;<i>Be Bold</i>. The next day he thanked the giver
of the fruit with emphasis. &ldquo;It was sweet to the core,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>After that the affair proceeded rapidly. The young
man, who, as may be guessed, did not hurry the case of his
patient, found an opportunity of declaring his love, and in
the following summer the two lovers fled together. All the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
arrangements had been carefully made. The girl feigned
sickness, and the physician prescribed a residence among
the hills and a simpler life and plainer diet than the patient
was likely to get in her father&rsquo;s house. Her foster-mother
was the wife of a sheep master who rented some extensive
pasture on the hills of Southern Armenia, and it was settled
that Amestris should pay her a visit. The lady was sent off
under a small escort, no one dreaming that the family of an
influential noble would be molested on its journey. Yet,
curiously enough, a band of brigands was bold enough to
enter the caravanserai where the party was lodging on the
fourth night after their departure from Susa. Certainly the
keeper of the inn, and, possibly, the commander of the
escort, had been bribed&mdash;Demoleon&rsquo;s successful practice had
put him in the command of as much money as he wanted.
For a long time Amestris absolutely disappeared. Her
father searched everywhere and offered munificent rewards
for information, but he could find and hear nothing. No
one knew that a couple of travellers, who might have been
two brothers journeying in company and followed by three
well armed servants, were in fact Demoleon, Amestris, and
the pretended robbers. The party followed much the same
route as was afterwards taken by the Ten Thousand, and,
after not a few hair-breadth escapes, arrived in safety at the
same destination,&mdash;the city of Trapezus.</p>

<p>Three years of happiness followed. Then the beautiful
Persian died. She never repented of having given
her heart to the young physician, who was the best
and most affectionate of husbands. But she missed her
family and all the associations of her early life, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
pined away under the loss. Return was impossible; she
could not go back without her husband, and to return
with him would have been to expose him, if not herself, to
the certainty of death. The hopelessness of the situation
broke her heart; and all her husband&rsquo;s skill, even the more
potent influence of her husband&rsquo;s love, failed to work a cure.</p>

<p>The widower could not prevail upon himself to leave the
place where he had enjoyed his short-lived happiness. He
might have gained wealth and fame in larger cities, but he
preferred to spend the rest of his days at Trapezus. There,
indeed, he was almost worshipped. He had a singularly light
and skillful hand; his experience, though, of course, not so
large as he might have collected elsewhere, was always
ready for use; and he had the rare, the incommunicable
gift of felicitous guessing&mdash;guessing we call it, but it is
really the power of forming rapid conclusions from a number
of trifling, often half discerned indications. Anyhow he
achieved some very marvellous cures; performed with success
operations which others did not venture to attempt;
diagnosed diseases with remarkable skill, and was extraordinarily
fertile in his expedients. It was specially characteristic
of him that while he was never satisfied till he had
thoroughly enquired into the causes of disease, he was unwearied
in his efforts to relieve the inconvenience and painfulness
of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms.</p>

<p>So alarming did the condition of Callias become after his
return from the banquet, that Demoleon was called in without
loss of time. All that he could do at the moment was
to give a sleeping draught, intending to make a thorough
examination of the case next morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after sunrise he was by the bedside. Callias was
conscious enough to be able to describe his feelings; what
he said indicated plainly enough that his illness had
been developing for some days past, and had been postponed
by sheer courage and determination. It was in fact something
like what we call gastric fever; and the experienced
physician saw enough to convince him that he should have
a hard battle to fight. The patient was young, vigorous,
apparently sound of constitution, and, as far as he could
learn, of temperate habits. All this was in favor of recovery;
but it was not more than was needed to give a glimpse of
hope.</p>

<p>Demochares, who had a strong regard for the young man,
as indeed every one had that had been brought into contact
with him, intercepted the physician as he was leaving the
house after a prolonged examination of the patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you find him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Demoleon shook his head. The gesture was not exactly
despairing, but it indicated plainly enough that the situation
was serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will put him all right before long?&rdquo; returned the
merchant, alarmed at the gravity of the physician&rsquo;s manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All these things lie on the knees of the gods,&rdquo; said
Demoleon, quoting from his favorite Homer. (It was a
maxim of his that a man who did not know his Homer was
little better than a fool.) It may be said that the physician
was more than a little brusque in manner and speech.
Twenty years of solitary life had made him so, for since his
wife&rsquo;s death he had held aloof from all the social life of the
place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails him?&rdquo; enquired the merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fever,&rdquo; was the brief reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it run high?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very high indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have bled him, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physician&rsquo;s answers to enquiries were generally as
short as the rules of politeness permitted; occasionally,
some of his questioners were disposed to think, even shorter;
but there were remarks that always made him fluent of
speech, though the fluency was not always agreeable to his
audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bleed him, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you say at once
stab him, poison him? No, sir, I have not bled him, and do
not intend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that it was usual in such cases,&rdquo; said the
merchant timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely you did,&rdquo; answered Demoleon, &ldquo;and there
are persons, I do not doubt, who would have done it, persons,
too, who ought to know better.&rdquo; This was levelled at
a rival practitioner in the town for whom he entertained a
most thorough contempt. &ldquo;Do you know, sir,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;where men learnt the practice of bleeding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; said Demochares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was from the hippopotamus. That animal has been
observed to bleed himself. Doubtless the operation does
him good. But it does not follow that what is good for an
animal as big as a cottage is good also for a man. Doubtless
there <i>are</i> men for whom it is good. When I have to deal
with a mountain of a man, one of your city dignitaries
bloated by rich feeding, by chines of beef and pork and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
flagons of rich wine, I don&rsquo;t hesitate to bleed him. His
thick skin, his rolls of fat flesh, seem to require it. In fact
he is a human hippopotamus. But to bleed a spare young
fellow, who has been going through months of labor and
hard living would be to kill him. I wonder that you can
suggest such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I am very sorry,&rdquo; said the merchant humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happily no harm is done,&rdquo; replied the physician, cooling
down a little. &ldquo;And, after all, this is not your business,
and you may be excused for your ignorance, but there are
others,&rdquo; he went off muttering in a low voice, &ldquo;who ought
to know better, and ought to be punished for such folly. It
is sheer murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not intend to describe the course of the long illness
of which this was the beginning. There were times when
even the hopefulness of the physician&mdash;and his hopefulness
was one of his strongest and most helpful qualities&mdash;failed
him. Relapse after relapse, coming with disheartening
frequency, just when he had seemed to have gathered a
little strength, brought him close to the gates of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done all that I can,&rdquo; said Demoleon one evening
to Epicharis the nurse. &ldquo;If any one is to save him, it
must be you. If you want me, send for me, of course.
Otherwise I shall not come. It breaks my heart to see this
fine young fellow dying, when there are hundreds of worthless
brutes whom the earth would be better without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Epicharis never lost heart; for a nurse to lose heart is
more fatal than the physician&rsquo;s despair. For nearly a week
she scarcely slept. Not a single opportunity of administering
some strengthening food did she lose&mdash;for now the fever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
had passed, and the danger lay in the excessive exhaustion.
At last her patience was rewarded. The sick man turned
the corner, and Demoleon, summoned at last, to alleviate,
he feared, the last agony, found, to his inexpressible delight,
that the cure was really begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the physician,&rdquo; he cried, as he seized the nurse&rsquo;s
hand and kissed it; &ldquo;I am only a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winter had passed into spring, and spring into summer,
before Callias could be pronounced out of danger. Even
then his recovery was slow. Some months were spent in a
mountain village where the bracing air worked wonders in
giving him back his strength. As the cold weather came
on he returned to his comfortable home in Trapezus.
Though scarcely an invalid, he was still a little short of
perfect recovery. Besides it was not the time for travelling.
Anyhow it was the spring of the following year, and now
more than twelve months from the time of his first illness,
when he was pronounced fit to travel. Even then it was
only something like flat rebellion on the part of his patient
that induced Demoleon to give way. The young man was
wearying for home and friends. He had heard nothing of
them for several months, for communication was always
stopped during the winter between Athens and the ports of
the Euxine, while the eastward bound ships that always
started after the dangerous season of the equinox had passed,
had not yet arrived.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>BACK TO ATHENS.</small></h2>


<p>Callias started about the middle of April, according to
our reckoning. His journey to the Bosphorus was much
retarded by contrary winds. For some days no progress
could be made, and it was well into May before he reached
Byzantium. There he was fortunate enough to get a passage
in a Spartan despatch boat, which took him as far as the
port of Corinth, thus carrying him, of course, beyond his
destination, but to a point from which it was easy for him
to find his way to Athens. It was about the beginning of
June when he landed at the Piraeus. He did not doubt for
a moment about the place where his first visit was due. The
fact was that he had no near relations. The kinsman who
was his legal guardian had always given up the business of
looking after his ward&rsquo;s property to Hippocles; and now
that Callias was his own master, there was little more than
a friendly acquaintance between the two cousins. The
alien&rsquo;s house was, he felt, his real home, nor had he given
up the hope that in spite of Hermione&rsquo;s strongly expressed
determination, he might some day become a member of his
family.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ACROPOLIS AT THE PRESENT DAY.</span>
</div>

<p>Hippocles happened to have just returned from his business
at the shipyard, when the young Athenian presented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
himself at the gate. Nothing could be warmer than the
welcome he gave his visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Zeus and Athene be thanked for this,&rdquo; he cried as
he wrung the young man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;That you had come
back safely from the country of the Great King I heard.
Your friend Xenophon told me so much in a letter that I
had from him about a year ago. Then I heard from him
that you were dangerously ill. After that all was a
blank, and I feared the worst. But why not a word all
this time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, my dear friend, I think I may say that it
was not my fault. For months I was simply too ill to write.
When I came back to Trapezus, the winter had begun, and
there were no more ships sailing westward. I should have
written when communications were opened again, but I was
always in hopes of being allowed by the physician to start,
and I had a fancy for bringing my own news. And how
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am well enough,&rdquo; replied Hippocles, &ldquo;but we have
been passing through times bad enough to shorten any
man&rsquo;s life. I don&rsquo;t speak of trade. There have been
troubles there, but when one has ventures all over the
world, it does not matter very much as far as profits are
concerned, if things do not go right at one place or another.
It has been the state of home affairs that has been the
heaviest burden to bear. I thought we had touched the
bottom when the city had to surrender to Lysander. But
it was not so, and I might have known better. The Spartans,
of course, upset the democracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interrupted Callias, &ldquo;I should have thought that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
that would not have been by any means an altogether unmixed
evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hippocles, &ldquo;and there have been times when
I have been ready to think the same. But wait till you see
an oligarchy in power, really in power, I mean, not with a
possible appeal to the people, and so a chance of having to
answer for themselves before them, but with a strong
foreign garrison behind them. We had that state of things
in Athens for more than half a year. One might almost
say that it was like a city taken by storm. No man&rsquo;s life
was safe unless he was willing to do the bidding of the Tyrants&mdash;the
&ldquo;Thirty Tyrants&rdquo; was the nickname of the men
that were in power in those days. Who would have thought
that Theramenes would ever have been regretted by honest
men? Yet it was so. He thought his colleagues were going
too far, and opposed them. He was carrying the Senate
with him, for many besides him were beginning to feel uncomfortable;
so they murdered him. The Thirty had, you
must know, a sort of sham general assembly&mdash;three thousand
citizens picked out of the whole number as holding strong
oligarchical opinions. Amongst the laws that they had made
one was that none of these Three Thousand were to be condemned
without a vote of the Senate. The name of Theramenes
was, of course, on the list, and, as he had a majority
of the Senate with him, he seemed safe. Well what did
Critias, who was the leader of the violent party, do? He
filled the outer circle of the Senate house with armed men,
the Senate, you must understand, sitting in the middle surrounded
by them. Then he got up and said, &lsquo;A good
president, when he sees the body over which he presides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
about to be duped, does not suffer them to follow their own
counsel. Theramenes has duped you, and I and these men
here will not suffer one who is the enemy of his country to
do so any longer. I have therefore struck his name off the
list of the Three Thousand. This leaves me and my colleagues
free to deal with him without your assent.&rsquo; The
Senate murmured, but dared do nothing more. The officers
came and dragged the man from the altar to which he was
clinging. An hour afterwards he had drunk the hemlock.
The gods below be propitious to him, for great as were his
misdeeds he died in a good cause and as a brave man should
die.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Things have not been so bad since the &lsquo;Thirty&rsquo; were
upset, but there is a sad story to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias paused awhile. At last he screwed up his courage
to put a question which he had both longed and feared to
put ever since he had set foot in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your daughter, is she well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And still with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is at home,&rdquo; briefly answered the father.</p>

<p>Hermione had in fact, refused several offers which every
one else had thought highly eligible. Hippocles, though by
no means anxious to lose a daughter who was not only a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>companion but a counsellor, was growing anxious at what
appeared her manifest determination to remain single. He
would have dearly liked to have a son-in-law who would be
able to take up in time the burden of his huge business, a
burden which he began to feel already somewhat heavy for
his strength. Callias would have been entirely to his heart,
but he had accepted, though not without great reluctance,
his daughter&rsquo;s views on this subject. That she should deny
the young Athenian&rsquo;s suit, and yet for his sake dismiss all
other suitors&mdash;and this he began to suspect to be the fact&mdash;seemed
to his practical mind a quite unreasonable course of
action. When a distant kinsman from Italy, a handsome
youth of gracious manners and of unexceptionable character,
with even a tincture of culture, was emphatically refused,
Hippocles ventured a remonstrance. Its reception was such
that he resolved never under any circumstances to repeat it.
Hermione had been always the most obedient of daughters,
but this roused her to open rebellion. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;in this matter I am and must be a freeborn Italian. A
Greek father can arrange a marriage for his daughter, but
you must not think of it. I shall give myself as my mother
gave herself before me&mdash;if I could find one as worthy as she
did,&rdquo; and she caught her father&rsquo;s hand and kissed it, breaking
at the same time into a passion of tears. &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo;
she went on in a broken voice, &ldquo;for setting up myself
against you; but if you love me, never speak on this subject
again.&rdquo; And her father resolved that he never would.</p>

<p>The young Athenian felt a glow of renewed hope pass
through him at the father&rsquo;s reply, studiously brief and cold
as it was. Anyhow Hermione was not married. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
could ever occur to change her purpose he did not care to
speculate. Nevertheless, as long as she did not belong to
another, he need not despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will dine with me of course,&rdquo; said Hippocles to his
visitor, &ldquo;by good luck I have invited Xenophon. Doubtless
that is he,&rdquo; he went on, as a kick was heard at the door.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>A few moments afterwards a slave introduced Xenophon;
and before the two friends had finished their greetings it
was announced that dinner had been served.</p>

<p>Hermione was not present at the meal, nor did her father
make any excuse for her absence. The presence of any
guest not belonging to the regular family circle, was sufficient
to account for it; and Callias, though he hoped against hope
to see her, could not but acknowledge to himself that a
meeting would have been highly embarrassing.</p>

<p>Conversation did not flag during the meal. When it was
finished, the host excused himself on the score of having
some business matters on hand which did not brook delay;
and Xenophon and Callias were left to talk over each other&rsquo;s
adventures.</p>

<p>When Callias had told the story with which my readers
are already acquainted, Xenophon proceeded to give him a
brief outline of his fortunes since they had parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear Callias,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you did not lose much
by not being with us. While we were in danger, we stuck
fairly together, though there were always cowardly and
selfish fellows who thought, not of the general welfare, but
only of their own skins or their own pockets. But when
we were safe at the coast and among friends, then there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
arose endless division. And, indeed, I must allow that the
situation of the army was very trying. Here were thousands
of men who lived by their pay, and there was no paymaster.
I had a scheme of my own which would really have kept us
together. If it could have been carried out, the gathering
of the Ten Thousand, even though it had failed of its first
object, would not have been altogether in vain. I wanted
to found a new Greek colony. We might have taken
Pharis or some other city of the barbarians; and if only half
of my comrades had been willing to stay, we might have
made a rich and powerful place of it before long. But it was
not to be. Perhaps I was not worthy of being the founder
of such a colony; anyhow the scheme came to nothing. I
will tell you how it was. You remember Silanus, the soothsayer.
I never trusted the man. He was quite capable of
garbling signs to suit his own advantage. However I
could not help going to him on this occasion, as he was the
chief of his craft. So I said, &lsquo;Offer sacrifices and determine
the omens concerning this scheme of a new colony.&rsquo; Now
Silanus was about the only man who had any money in his
pocket. Cyrus had given him three thousand darics<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> for a
prophecy that had come true, and he wanted to get home
with the spoil. So he was altogether against the idea of a
colony. When he had sacrificed he could not say that the
omens were altogether against the scheme; for I knew
nearly as much about the matter as he did. What he did
say was that there were indications of a conspiracy against
me. And he took good care to make them true, for he
spread about reports of what I was going to do that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
turned the army against me. So the scheme came to
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This did one good thing, however, for it helped us on our
way home. Trapezus and the other colonies in the east of
the Euxine did not relish the idea of a new Greek city which
might turn out to be a formidable rival. So they offered to
transport the army to the Hellespont and to furnish pay
from the first new moon after the departure. This seemed
a good offer, and I recommended the soldiers to close with
it, and said that I gave up my scheme. &lsquo;Only,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;let
us all keep together and let any one who leaves us be
counted a malefactor.&rsquo; For I did not choose that my friend
the soothsayer should get the better of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we set sail; our first halt was at Sinope, which is
roughly speaking, about halfway between Trapezus and
Byzantium. Then the army wanted to make me commander-in-chief.
Happily the omen was against it, and I was able
to decline. We started again, and got to Heraclea. The
people were very hospitable; but some scoundrels in the
army wanted to lay a contribution upon the city. Chirisophus,
the Spartan&mdash;I should have told you that on my refusal
the army gave him the chief command&mdash;refused to
have anything to do with such an abominable business, and
I backed him up. Of course the city shut its gates against
us, and we got nothing at all. After this the army broke up
into three. One of the divisions, made up of Arcadians and
Achaeans, the most unscrupulous and greedy of the whole
number, got into serious trouble when they were trying to
plunder the country, and I had to rescue them, for two
thousand men had stuck to me when the army was thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
broken up. Then the other division under Chirisophus
were nearly as badly off, and I had to get them out of a
scrape. After this they came together again, and it was
made a matter of death for anyone to propose a separation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was well we did, for everyone seemed bent on treating
us as villanously as possible. Would you believe that the
Spartan governor of Byzantium actually sold as slaves four
hundred soldiers who had found their way into the city? It
is true that they were stragglers and had no business there;
but it was an abominable act. At last, one Seuthes, who
had been chief of the Odrysians, and deposed by a usurper,
offered to take the whole army into his pay, if we would
help him to recover his dominions. Every man was to receive
a stater<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> per month, the captains twice, and the
generals four times as much. Also he offered lands, oxen
to plough it with, and a city with walls. In fact the colony
scheme seemed likely to be carried out after all. To me he
was very munificent in his promises. I was to have one of
his daughters to wife and a city of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to that?&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the only one of these things that Seuthes really
had in his possession was the daughter. I saw the young
lady, handsome I will allow, and tall; but, oh, such a
savage! As for the money, and the land, and the oxen, and
the towns, walled and unwalled, we had to get them for him
and then have our portion back. However, it seemed to me
the best thing for the army to do, and I advised the men to
that effect, and they agreed, only it was provided that we
were never to march more than seven days&rsquo; journey from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the seacoast. We had all had enough of marches up the
country. Then Seuthes gave us a feast by way of striking
the bargain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a wonderful scene, and some day I must tell you
all about it. But I must own that for a time I felt as uncomfortable
as ever I did in my life. After dinner when the
bowl had passed round two or three times, in came a Thracian
leading a white horse. He took the bowl from the cup-bearer,
and said, &lsquo;Here is a health to thee, King Seuthes.
Let me give you this horse. Mounted on him thou shalt
take whom thou wilt, and when thou retirest from the
battle thou shalt dread no pursuer.&rsquo; Then another gave a
slave, and another some robes for the Queen, and a fourth a
silver saucer and a finely embroidered carpet. All the while
I was sitting in an agony, for I was in the place of honor,
and had nothing to offer. However &lsquo;our lady of Athens,&rsquo;
who is the inspirer of clever devices, and, it may be Father
Bacchus also, for I had drained two or three cups, helped me
out of my difficulty. When the cup-bearer handed me the
goblet, I rose and said, &lsquo;King Seuthes, I present you with
myself and these my trusty comrades. With their help you
will recover the lands that were your forefathers&rsquo; and gain
many new lands with them. Nor shall you win lands only,
but horses many, and men many, and fair women also.&rsquo;
Up got the King, at this, and we drained the cup together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seuthes was not going to let the grass grow under his feet.
When we left the banqueting tent&mdash;this was at sunset because
we wanted to set the guards about our camp&mdash;the King,
who, for all his potations, was as sober as a water-drinker,
sent for the generals and said, &lsquo;My neighbors have not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
heard of this alliance of ours. Let us go and take them by
surprise.&rsquo; And so we did. We went that night and brought
back booty enough to pay for our day&rsquo;s pay, I warrant you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we went on fighting for Seuthes for two months till
we had conquered the whole countryside for him. Then
the conquered tribes flocked to him&mdash;give a Thracian plenty
to eat and drink and good pay and he will fight in any
quarrel&mdash;till he did not want any more. That perhaps was
not to be wondered at, but, like the mean hound that he was,
he tried to get out of paying us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just at this moment when I thought that we should have
to settle with the sword for judge, Sparta declared war
against the Persians and wanted all the men she could get.
So Thuisbron, their commander-in-chief, came over and engaged
the men at the same rate of pay that Seuthes was
giving or rather promising. We never got anything but a
wretched fragment from the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this time I had had about enough of campaigning of
this fashion. Not a drachma had I made. In fact I was
poorer than when I set out. I had even to sell my favorite
horse, but Thuisbron bought it back for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just at the last I had a stroke of luck. That is another
story I must tell you some day. But fortunately we took
prisoners a Persian noble with his wife and children, his
horses and cattle and all that he had. The next day I left
the army, but before I went they gave me the pick of the
beasts of all kinds. It was a handsome present, I can tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, on the whole,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;you came pretty well
out of the business. You returned at least not poorer than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
you went, you have won for yourself a name which those
who come after us will not, I take it, forget, and you helped,
at least, to save the lives of many Greeks from perishing
shamefully by the hands of the barbarians. Are you not
content?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Xenophon, &ldquo;all the more content on
account of one thing you have not mentioned. For this indeed
pleases me in the matter that we Greeks have now
found a way by which we may both go to the capital of the
Persians and return therefrom. Verily, I sometimes wish
we had not been so eager to retreat, but had stopped and
made ourselves masters of the country of our enemies. Perhaps
we were not strong enough; but, if I can see so far into
the future, some one will do this hereafter, and Greece will
be avenged of all that she has suffered at the hands of the
barbarians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Master will be glad,&rdquo; Callias went on after a pause.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Master&rdquo; of course was Socrates. Xenophon looked
at the young man with some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem very confident on this point. He indeed was
always somewhat doubtful, and certainly there are great
difficulties when you come to look into it a little more
closely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really do not know what you mean,&rdquo; answered Callias;
&ldquo;you have seen him I suppose, for you have been in Athens
several days and know what he thinks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few moments Xenophon stared at the speaker in
utter perplexity. Then a light broke in upon him. &ldquo;What,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;you do not know? You have not heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know what? Have heard what? You speak in riddles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man covered his face with his hands. After a
few minutes he recovered calmness enough to speak. &ldquo;No,
indeed, I did not know it. I never thought of such a thing.
He seemed so full of life and vigor. Yet he must have been
an old man, not far from seventy I suppose, for he was
more than forty at Delium.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Tell me of what did he die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They killed him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Killed him! Who killed him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people of Athens.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>THE STORY OF THE TRIAL.</small></h2>


<p>It is not too much to say that the young man was prostrated
by the news which he had just heard, for the blow
fell upon him with a suddenness that seemed to increase the
pain tenfold. He had not been indeed on the same intimate
terms of friendship with the great philosopher as the older
disciples, Crito, Simmias, Cebes, Phaedo and others had
been. But he had regarded him with an affection and admiration
that was nothing less than enthusiastic; and he
had looked forward to getting his advice about the future
conduct of his life with a hopeful eagerness that made disappointment
very bitter. To find himself in Athens after
all the vicissitudes of fortune through which he had passed,
and to learn that the man without whom Athens scarcely
seemed itself, was lost to him forever, was a terrible shock.
Xenophon&rsquo;s sorrow had not been less keen, but he had been
prepared for his loss by at least a few days&rsquo; previous knowledge.
The news had reached him while he was on his way,
and the first shock was over when he landed. But there
had been nothing to break the news to Callias. He felt as a
son might feel who returns home after a long absence in
full expectation of a father&rsquo;s greeting, and finds himself an
orphan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>So overpowered was the young man that he felt solitude
to be absolutely necessary for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me talk to you about it another day,&rdquo; he said to
Xenophon, &ldquo;at present I am not master of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xenophon clasped his friend&rsquo;s hand with a warm and
sympathetic pressure. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yet, I
think it will comfort you when you hear how he bore himself
at the last and what he said. Come to me to-morrow;
Hippocles will tell you where I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Callias presented himself at
Xenophon&rsquo;s house, a modest little dwelling, not far from
the garden of Academus. He found him in the company
of some friends, most of whom were more or less known to
the young man as having been members of the circle which
had been accustomed to listen to the teaching of the great
master. Crito, Menexenus and &AElig;schines, and the two
Thebans, Cebes and Simmias, were among the number; and
there were others whom he did not recognize. He was
greeted with kindness and even distinction. His host had
evidently been giving a favorable account of him to the
company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it best,&rdquo; Xenophon went on to explain, &ldquo;to
ask some of those who were actually present when these
things happened, to meet you. I myself, as you know, was
not here; and it is well that you should hear a story so important
from eye-witnesses, men who saw his demeanor
with their own eyes, and heard his words with their own
ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Callias. &ldquo;But tell me first how it
was that such things came to pass. It seems incredible to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
me. I have heard that here and there a man has been found
so monstrously wicked that he could kill his own father,
though Solon thought it so impossible a crime that he would
impose no penalty on it. But that a whole people should
be stricken with such madness of wickedness seems to pass
all imagination or belief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you do not understand,&rdquo; said Simmias; &ldquo;I am a
foreigner you know; and those who look at things from
outside often see more of them than they who are within. I
had long thought that Socrates was making many enemies
in Athens. And verily if he had said such things in my
own city, as he said here, I doubt whether he had been
suffered to live so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he always spoke true things,&rdquo; said the young man,
&ldquo;and things that were to the real profit of his hearers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Simmias, &ldquo;but that they were true
and profitable did not make them pleasant, or the speaker
of them welcome. What think you would happen to a
school-master if his pupils whom he daily corrects and disciplines,
sometimes with hard tasks and sometimes with
blows, were permitted to judge him, or to a physician if
the children whom he seeks to cure of their ailments with
nauseous drugs, or, it may be, with the knife or cautery,
had him in their power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, it might fare ill with him,&rdquo; Callias confessed,
thinking to himself of certain angry thoughts that in his
own boyhood he had cherished against his own teacher and
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;Simmias is right, nor did this matter
escape the notice of us Athenians, though we did not per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>ceive
it so plainly. You, I know, have been much absent
from Athens since you grew to manhood, yet you must have
seen something of this. You were here, for example, when
the admirals were condemned after the battle at Arginus&aelig;.
Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was here,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know how Socrates set himself against the
will of the people, refusing to put to the vote a proposal
which he believed to be unconstitutional. Well, he suffered
nothing at that time, because their will prevailed in spite
of him. Yet we saw that there were many who remembered
this against him, and only waited for the opportunity of
avenging themselves upon him. Nor was he less constant
in opposing the few, when he believed them to be acting
wrongfully, than in opposing the many. Listen now, to
what he did and said in the days of the Thirty. Were you
in Athens at that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Callias, &ldquo;I left the city, or rather was
carried away from it&mdash;&rdquo; at this there was a general laugh,
most of the company having heard of the curious story of
his abduction&mdash;&ldquo;after the murder of the Generals, and did
not set foot in it till the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know what manner of men these Thirty were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, among other vile things that they did was this,
that they put to death many excellent men whom they
conceived to be enemies to themselves. Then Socrates, in
that free way of his, said, &lsquo;If a herdsman were so to manage
his herd that the cattle became fewer and not more, men
would consider him a bad herdsman. Still more would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
they consider him to be a bad ruler of a city who should so
manage it that the citizens became not more but less
numerous.&rsquo; This being reported to Critias, who was a chief
among the Thirty, he sent for Socrates, and said to him,
&lsquo;There is a law that no man shall teach or use the art of
words.&rsquo; Socrates said, &lsquo;Mean you by this, the art of words
rightly spoken or the art of words wrongly spoken?&rsquo; On
this, one Charicles, who was a colleague of Critias, and was
standing by him, broke in violently: &lsquo;Since, Socrates, you
find it so hard to understand an altogether easy thing, take
this as a plain rule, that you are not to talk with young men
at all.&rsquo; &lsquo;Truly I desire to obey the law,&rsquo; said Socrates; &lsquo;tell
me then what you mean by young men. How young? Up
to what age?&rsquo; Charicles said, &lsquo;Up to thirty, at which age
men are able to take part in affairs of the State.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
said Socrates, &lsquo;if I desire to buy a thing of a man who is
under thirty, is it permitted me to ask what it costs?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Charicles, &lsquo;you may say so much.&rsquo; &lsquo;And if a man
under thirty asks me where Critias lives or Charicles lives,
may I answer him?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, you may answer such questions,&rsquo;
said Charicles. Then Critias broke in, &lsquo;But you must
not talk about blacksmiths and coppersmiths and tanners;
and indeed you have worn these themes pretty well threadbare
by this time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nor about righteousness and wickedness
and such things, I suppose,&rsquo; said Socrates. &lsquo;No, indeed,
nor about herdsmen. If you speak of herdsmen and of the
herd being diminished, take care that it be not diminished
by one more, even by you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias listened with delight. &ldquo;Oh, how like him!&rdquo; he
cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Crito, &ldquo;like him indeed, and truly admirable.
But such things do not please those to whom they are
spoken, especially do not please men in power. Then consider
the number of empty-headed, ignorant fellows whose
vanity and conceit he exposed every day by his pitiless
questioning. There was not a pretentious fool in Athens
whom he had not at some time or other held up to ridicule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they deserved it richly,&rdquo; said Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;but I have never found that a
man liked punishment more because he knew that he
deserved it. So you see that the city was full of his enemies.
And there were some honest men who really believed that
he did harm by his teaching. What with knaves whom he
opposed with all his might, and fools whom he exposed, and
right-minded, wrong-headed men whom he could not help
offending, there was a very formidable host arrayed against
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Callias. &ldquo;But they must have had some
pretext, they could not put any of the things you have been
speaking about into a formal charge. Tell me, what did
they accuse him of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was the old story, treason and blasphemy. Men
who would have sold their country for a quarter of a talent,
men who believe in no other gods than their own lusts, were
loud in proclaiming that Socrates had ruined the State, and
was teaching the young not to worship the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Callias, &ldquo;how dared they utter
such lies? A better patriot, a truer worshipper of the gods
never lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right; yet, these were the charges against him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
these and other things equally absurd, as that he taught
the young to despise their fathers and to think meanly of
all their relatives and friends, as if he himself were the only
friend that was worth having; that he perverted words from
Homer and the old poets to a bad sense, making them mean
that no work was disgraceful so that it brought in gain, and
that it was lawful for kings and nobles to beat the common
people<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>&mdash;these were the charges that they brought against
him. And then they added the accusation that Critias
and Alcibiades who had done great harm to Athens had both
been disciples of his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; said Callias, &ldquo;how did these liars and
villains proceed? And first, who were they? Who took
the lead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One Meletus was the chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! The foolish poet whom every one laughs at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the very same. He represented the poets. There
was one Lycon, of whom, I suppose, you never heard, who
represented the public speakers, and Anytus, one of those
who came back with Thrasybulus. He had been badly
treated, it is true, banished without any good reason, but
only a madman could have supposed that Socrates had had
anything to do with it. These three brought the indictment.
It was in these words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Socrates is guilty of a crime. He does not acknowledge
the gods whom the State acknowledges, and he introduces
other and new gods. He is also guilty of corrupting the
youth. The penalty&mdash;death.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But such charges hardly needed a defence. Is it possible
that a number of Athenian judges found a verdict of guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so indeed,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;and I am not sure that
you will be altogether surprised when you hear what the
accused said in his own defence. I am an old man now,
and have watched the courts now for many years; and I
have seen not a few men who might have escaped but for
what they said in their own behalf. Now I can&rsquo;t tell you
all that Socrates said, or even the greater part of it. Our
friend Plato is going to set it forth regularly in a book that
he is writing. But I can tell you enough to make you see
what I mean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After he had dealt with various other matters&mdash;those
calumnies for instance, that Aristophanes set afloat about
him now more than thirty years ago&mdash;he went on: &lsquo;Some
years ago, men of Athens, a certain Chaerephon&mdash;you know
him; some of you went into exile along with him&mdash;having
been my companion from my youth up, ventured to go to
Delphi, and to propose this question to the god: &ldquo;Is there
any man wiser than Socrates?&rdquo; The Pythia<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> made reply,
&ldquo;There is none wiser than he.&rdquo; When I heard this I said
to myself, what can the god mean? He cannot tell a lie,
yet I am not conscious to myself of possessing any kind of
wisdom. So at last I devised this plan. I went to one of
the men who are reckoned wise, thinking thus to test the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
oracle, so that I might say, here at least is one that is wiser
than I. Now when I came to examine this man&mdash;he was
one of our statesmen, men of Athens,&mdash;I found that though
he was accounted wise by many and especially by himself,
he was not wise in reality. But in vain I tried to convince
him, and I even became odious to him and to many others
who were present and admired him. Then I thought to
myself, I am at least wiser than this man, for he not knowing,
thinks that he knows, while I at least know that I do
not know. After this, I went to the poets, tragic, lyrical,
and others, and taking to them poems which they had
written, asked of them what they meant thereby. And I
found that almost always those that had not written these
things knew better what they meant than the authors. So
I concluded that these also were not wise. And at last I
went to the artisans, knowing that they were acquainted
with many things of which I knew nothing. And this,
indeed, I found to be the case. But I also found that, because
they had mastered their own art, each thought himself
very wise in other things, things, too, of the greatest
importance, and that this self-conceit spoilt their wisdom.
These also seemed to be less wise than myself. But all the
time that I was doing this I knew that I was making myself
hateful to many, yet, because I was bound to obey the god
as best I could, I did not desist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is true also that many young men hearing me thus
questioning others have found delight in this employment
and have learnt to imitate me. And they have obtained
this result: they have found many persons who think
that they know much but in reality know nothing. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
they who are thus discovered are irritated, not so much
against their questioners, but against me whom they suppose
to have taught them this habit. Hence comes this fable of
a certain wicked Socrates who is said to corrupt the young
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nevertheless, O men of Athens, if you this day release
me, I shall not therefore cease to do that which, as I conceive,
the god commands. I shall go about the city seeking
wisdom; nor shall I cease to say to such as come in my
way, My friend, can you, being a citizen of Athens, the
most famous city of Greece, help being ashamed if you make
riches or rank your highest aim, and care not for that which
is indeed the greatest good? This shall I still do to young
or old, for it is this that the god orders me to do!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crito paused in his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; cried Callias, &ldquo;but how did the judges
take it? It was a downright defiance of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it was, and so they thought it. There was a
tremendous uproar. When the noise had ceased, he began
again:&mdash;&lsquo;Do not clamor against me, men of Athens, but
hear me patiently; &rsquo;tis indeed for your own good that you
should. For be assured that putting me to death, you will
harm yourselves rather than me. For, having rid yourselves
of me, you will not easily find any one who will do
for you the office that I have done, which has been, I take
it, that of a rider upon a horse of good breed, indeed, and
strong, but needing the spur. Such a rider have I been to
the city, sitting close and exciting you continually by persuasion
and reproach. You will not easily find another like
me; and if you are angry with me, yet remember that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
persons awakened out of sleep are angry with the man who
rouses them, though it may be to the saving of their lives.
And remember this too: what I have done, I have done
without pay; no one can bring up this against me that I
have done anything for gain. If you ask a proof, look at
my poverty&mdash;that is proof enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And if any one ask me why I go about meddling
with every body and giving them advice, and yet never
come forward and give any advice about matters of state, I
make him this answer: There is a voice within me, of
which Meletus idly speaks as if it were another god, which
never indeed urges me to do anything, but often warns me
against doing this or that. This same voice has often
warned me against taking part in public affairs, and rightly
so indeed, for be assured that if I had so taken part, I should
long ago have perished. And do not be offended if I tell you
the truth. No man can be safe who opposes things wrong
and illegal that are done by the people. If he would live,
even but for a short time, he must keep to a private station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you not remember, men of Athens, how when you
had to judge the admirals that did not save the shipwrecked
men at Arginus&aelig;, I would not put the motion to the vote?
For though I had never held any public office I was in the
Senate, and it so chanced that my tribe that day had the
presidency. You chose to judge all the men together, acting
wrongfully, as you afterward acknowledged. And I
alone of all the presidents opposed this thing, and would
not yield, no not when the orators denounced me, and
would have joined me with the accused. This was in the
time of the democracy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And afterwards when the democracy was overthrown,
and the oligarchy was in power, what happened? Did not
the Thirty send for me along with four others to their
council-chamber, and bid us fetch Leon of Salamis, that he
might be put to death. This they did, after their habit,
seeking to involve as many as possible in their wicked
deeds. Then also I showed not in words only, but in deeds
that I cared not one jot for death. For in the chamber I
declared that I would not do this thing, and when we had
gone out, the other four indeed went to Salamis, and fetched
Leon, but I went to my own home. Doubtless I should
have died for this act, but that the Thirty were overthrown
soon afterward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what I have done publicly that I have privately
also. Never have I conceded anything that was wrong to
any man. But if any man would hear what I said I never
grudged him the opportunity. I have offered myself to
rich and poor, whether they would question me themselves
or answer my questions, nor have I spoken for pay, nor been
silent because I was not paid, nor have I ever said aught to
any man that I have not said to all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So much, men of Athens, might suffice for my defence,
but if any of you, remembering that other men when
accused have brought their children before you seeking to
rouse compassion, are angry with me because I have not so
done, let him listen to me. I, too, have family ties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From no gnarled oak I sprang, or flinty rock, as Homer
has it, but am born of man. Three sons I have; two of
them are children, one an infant. Should I then bring
them before you, and seek to move your pity by the sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
of them? Not so. I have seen many thus demeaning
themselves, as if, forsooth, you acquitting them, they would
escape death altogether; but such behavior would ill befit
those who seek to follow after virtue and honor. Nor is
such behavior only unseemly; it is wrong. For we are
bound to convince a judge, not to persuade him, and he is
set in his place not to give justice as a favor, but because it
is justice. Verily, if I should have to persuade you to act
against your oaths I should be condemning myself of the
very charge that Meletus has brought against me, for I
should act as if I did not believe that the gods by whom ye
have sworn to do right are gods at all. Far be it from me
so to act. I believe in the gods more than my accusers believe;
and I leave it to these gods and to you to judge concerning
me as it may be best for you and for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No man,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;could have spoken better; but
it was not the speech that would please or conciliate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was the result?&rdquo; asked Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all there was only a majority of <i>six</i> against him;
two hundred and eighty-one against two hundred and
seventy-five were the numbers. Then came the question of
the sentence. The prosecutor had demanded the penalty of
death. &lsquo;Socrates,&rsquo; said the president of the court, &lsquo;what
penalty do you yourself propose?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> &lsquo;You ask me,&rsquo; said
Socrates, &lsquo;what penalty I myself propose. What then do I
deserve, I who have not sought to make money, or to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
office in the state, or to command soldiers and ships, who
have not even attended to my own affairs, but have sought
to do to others what I thought to be their highest good?
What should be done to me for being such a man? Surely
something good, something suitable to one who is your
benefactor, and who requires leisure that he may spend it in
giving you good advice. There is nothing, I conceive, more
suitable than that I should be maintained at the public expense
in the Town Hall, with those who have done great
services to the State. Surely I deserve such a reward far
more than he who has won a chariot race at the Olympic
games; for he only makes you think yourselves fortunate,
whereas I teach you to be happy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course there was a loud murmur of disapprobation at
this. Even some of those who had voted for acquittal were
vexed at language so bold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Socrates began again: &lsquo;You think that I show too much
pride when I talk in this fashion. But it is not so. Let me
show you what I mean. As to the penalty which the
accuser demands, I cannot say whether it be good or evil;
but the other things which I might propose in its stead I
know to be evils&mdash;imprisonment, or a fine with imprisonment
till it be paid, or exile, which last, indeed, you might
accept. But if you cannot endure my ways, O men of
Athens, think you that others would endure them? And
what a life for a man of my age to lead, this wandering
from city to city! But if anyone should say, Why, O Socrates,
will you not depart to some other city, and there live
quietly, and hold your tongue? I answer, To do this would
be to disobey the god, and I cannot do it. And indeed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
live without talking and questioning about such matters is
not to live at all. But I have not yet named the penalty.
If I had money I should propose some fine which I could
pay; but I have none, except indeed you are willing to impose
upon me some small fine, for I think that I could
raise a pound of silver.&rsquo; At this there was another growl
from the judges; and some of us who were standing by
Socrates caught him by the robe, and whispered to him.
After a pause, he said, &lsquo;Some of my friends, Crito and
Plato and Apollodorus, advise me to propose a fine of thirty
minas<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and offer to be security. So I propose that sum.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the result was certain. A majority much
larger than before voted for the death penalty. Then the
condemned man spoke for the last time. You will be able
to read for yourself the very words that he said. I can now
give you only an idea of the end of his speech. He had
told the judges, speaking especially to those who had voted
for his acquittal, that the voice that was wont to warn him
had never hindered him in the course of his speech, though
it was not the speech that he should have made if he had
wanted to save his life. From this he argued that he and
they had reason to believe that death was a good thing.
&lsquo;Either,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the dead are nothing and feel nothing, or
they remove hence to some other place. What can be better
than to feel nothing? What days or nights in all our lives
are better than those nights in which we sleep soundly
without even a dream? But if the common belief is true,
and we pass in death to that place wherein are all who have
ever died, what greater good can there be than this? If one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>passes from those who are called judges here to those who
really judge and administer true justice, to &AElig;acus and
Minos and Rhadamanthus, is this a change to be lamented?
What would not any one of you give to join the company of
Homer and Orpheus and Hesiod? or talk with those who
led that great army of Greeks to Troy, or with any of the many
thousands of good men and women that have lived upon the
earth? Verily, I would die many times if I could only
hope to do this. And now it is time&rsquo;&mdash;for these were his
very last words of all&mdash;&lsquo;that we should separate. I go to
die, you remain to live; but which of us is going the better
way, only the gods know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a deep silence in the room after Crito had
finished speaking. It was broken at last by Callias, who
asked, &ldquo;How long since was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly two months,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;but by a strange
chance Socrates was not put to death for nearly a month
after his condemnation. It so happened that the Sacred
Ship started for Delos just at the time, and during its voyage&mdash;in
fact from the moment that the priest fastens the
chaplet on the stern&mdash;no man can be put to death. For
thirty days then he was kept in prison. There we were
permitted to visit him, and there we heard many things
that are well worth being remembered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to hear everything,&rdquo; cried Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall in good time,&rdquo; said Crito. &ldquo;Come to my
house to-morrow and I will put you in the way of your
getting what you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you ought to hear,&rdquo; cried Apollodorus, who had
hitherto taken no part in the conversation, &ldquo;what the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
teacher said to me, though, indeed, it shows no great wisdom
in me that he had occasion to say it. &lsquo;O Socrates,&rsquo; I
said, when I saw him turning away from the place where
he had stood before his judges&mdash;and nothing could be more
cheerful than his look&mdash;&lsquo;O Socrates, this indeed is the hardest
thing to bear that you should have been condemned unjustly.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, not so, my friend,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;would the
matter have been more tolerable if I had been condemned
justly?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a general laugh. &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Crito,
&ldquo;but certainly as far as Athens is concerned, it was a more
shameful thing.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>THE LAST CONVERSATION.</small></h2>


<p>Callias, as may be supposed, did not fail to keep his appointment
with the utmost punctuality. He found at
Crito&rsquo;s house very nearly the same company that had been
assembled the day before at Xenophon&rsquo;s. After the
usual greetings had been interchanged, the host said,
&ldquo;I propose, if it is agreeable to you all, to hold the
conversation which we are to have to-day at the house
of our friend Plato. He has written to invite us, not
because he can himself see us, for he is not sufficiently
recovered from his late illness, but because we shall
thus be able to talk with his friend Phaedo; for as all
know there is no more fitting person than Phaedo to tell
our young friend Callias the things that he desires to
hear. For though we were all present, Xenophon only excepted,
on that day when the Master left us, having given
us his last instructions, yet there is no one who so well remembers
and is so well able to describe all that was then
said or done. I propose, therefore, that we transfer ourselves
to his house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proposition met with general assent and the party
set out.</p>

<p>Crito naturally took charge of Callias as being his special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
guest. As the two were walking, the young man said,
&ldquo;Tell me, Crito, if it is not unpleasing to you, whether
in the thirty days during which the Master was held in
prison, any efforts were made to save his life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;that you have asked me that
question privately and not before others, for, indeed, this is
a matter which has caused me no little amount of trouble
and shame. Some people blame me because, they say,
though a rich man I did not bribe the jailer of the prison in
which Socrates was confined, and thus enable him to escape.
I am blameable, indeed, but for an exactly opposite reason.
I did bribe the man&mdash;this of course is in absolute confidence
between you and me&mdash;and in this, as the Master showed me,
I was wrong. Indeed I never received from him so severe
a rebuke as I did concerning this matter. But let me tell
you what happened. I had arranged everything. The
jailer was to let him escape. There were people ready to
carry him out of the country. I went to him early in the
morning of the day when the ship was expected to return.
I told him what I had done. I made light of the money
that the affair was to cost. I could well afford it, I said,
and if I could not there were others ready to contribute.
And then I attacked him, it was an impudent thing to do,
but I felt as if I could do anything that we should not lose
him. I told him that it was wrong of him to do his best to
let his enemies get their way. I said to him, &lsquo;Thus acting
you desert your children, whom you might bring up and
educate. But if you die you will leave them orphans and
friendless. Either you ought not to have children or you
ought to take some trouble about them. Surely this does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
not become one who has made virtue his study throughout
his life. And remember what a disgrace will fall upon us,
for it will certainly be said that we did not do our best to save
your life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I cannot tell you now a tenth part of what he said.
I have it all written down at home, but I may say what you
will easily believe that I was as helpless in his hands as the
veriest pretender whom he has ever cross-examined. I
know that he ended by making me thoroughly ashamed of
myself. One of his chief arguments was this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Suppose, Crito, that as I was in the act of escaping, the
State itself were to say to me: Are you not seeking to
destroy by so acting the laws of the State itself? Is not
that State already dissolved wherein public sentences are set
aside by private persons? What should I answer to such
questions? And if the laws were to say, What complaint
have you got to make against us that you seek to destroy us?
Do you not owe your being to us, seeing that your father
and mother married according to our ordering? Have we
not given you nurture, education, all the good things that
you possess as being an Athenian? Have you not acknowledged
us by living in the city, by having children in it?
And if they were further to say, Verily, he who acts in this
way in which you are about to act is a corrupter of youth&mdash;what
could I answer?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And tell me, Crito,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;whither would you
have me betake myself? Not surely to any well-ordered city
seeing that I had shown myself the enemy of such order,
but rather to some abode of riot, which would indeed ill become
one who had professed to be a lover of virtue and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
righteousness. And as for my children, how shall I benefit
them? By taking them elsewhere and bringing them up
not as citizens of Athens, but as citizens of some other State
which I myself here have judged inferior, seeing that all my
life long I have deliberately preferred Athens to it?&rsquo; Verily,
Callias, when he said this, I had no answer. But here we
are at Phaedo&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias was not a little surprised when he was introduced
to the man whom he had been brought to see. Phaedo was
a man much younger than himself; indeed he had scarcely
completed his eighteenth year. His appearance was singularly
attractive, and his manners had all the grace and ease
of a well-born and well-bred man. That he was not an
Athenian was evident from his speech, which was somewhat
tinged with a Doric accent. Altogether Callias was at
a loss to think who or what he could be, and how he came
to be regarded as the best interpreter of the Master&rsquo;s last
words. An opportunity, however, arrived for enlightening
him. After a few minutes&rsquo; conversation, a slave appeared with
a message for the master of the house. Plato who had been
compelled to absent himself from the last interview with
Socrates, as has been said, was still so unwell that his
physician forbade the excitement of seeing visitors. He
now sent for Phaedo to entrust him with a message of
apology for his fellow disciples whom he was unable to
entertain, and partly to set him free to act the part of host
in his stead.</p>

<p>Crito seized the opportunity of his temporary absence
from the room to give some particulars about him. &ldquo;He
comes of a very good family in Elis, and was taken prisoner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
about this time last year when Athens and Sparta were
allies and acting against that country. He was sold in the
slave market here, and I cannot tell the cruelties that he
endured from the wretch who bought him. Somehow he
heard of Socrates, ran away from his owner and begged for the
Master&rsquo;s protection. Of course, the only thing was to buy
him, and equally of course, Socrates was wholly unable to
do this. But the Master, if he had no wealth of his own,
happily had wealthy friends. He went to Plato and, by
great good luck, Plato had a very powerful hold over the
poor fellow&rsquo;s owner; the man owed him a large sum of
money, the interest of which was overdue. He was purchased,
and at once set free. Plato found that he had been
remarkably well educated and that he showed an extraordinary
aptitude for philosophy. The lad&rsquo;s devotion to
Socrates was unbounded. He never lost a chance of being
near him; he was present of course at the last day, and he
watched and listened with an intense earnestness that
seemed to engrave everything on his mind as one engraves
letters upon marble or bronze. But, see, he is coming back.
Now you will understand why I have brought you to see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man, at this moment, returned to the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Phaedo,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;what you saw and heard
on the last day of the Master&rsquo;s life. My friend Callias here,
who has just come back from campaigning against the Great
King, desires to hear it from you, and, indeed, though we
all were present on that day, you seem to remember it more
accurately than any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; said the youth modestly. &ldquo;I do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
know,&rdquo; he went on, addressing himself especially to Callias,
&ldquo;whether you will wholly understand me when I say that
I did not feel compassion as one might feel for one who was
dying&mdash;he was so calm and so happy. Neither, on the other
hand, did I feel the pleasure that commonly followed from
his discourses, for I knew that he would soon cease to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just so with all of us,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;but go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had been to visit Socrates daily through the time of
his imprisonment, assembling very early in the morning,
and waiting till the doors of the prison were opened, and so
we did on this day, only earlier than usual, because we
knew that the Sacred Ship had arrived the evening before.
The jailer came out. &lsquo;You must wait, gentlemen,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;the Eleven<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> are with him. They are taking off his chains,
and are telling him that he must die to-day.&rsquo; After a little
while the man came out again, and said that we might go
in. When we went in, we found Socrates sitting on the
side of his bed, and his wife, Xanthippe, near him, holding
one of his children in her arms. As soon as she saw us, she
began to lament and say, &lsquo;O Socrates, here are your friends
come to see you for the last time.&rsquo; Then Socrates, looking
at her, said to Crito, &lsquo;Let some one take her home.&rsquo; So one
of Crito&rsquo;s servants led her away. After a while, for of course
I must leave out many things, the Master said, &lsquo;I have a
message for Evenus, who seeks to know, I am told, why I
have taken to writing verses in prison. Tell him that a god
appeared to me in a dream and told me to cultivate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
muses. Tell him also that if he is wise he will follow me as
speedily as possible, for it seems that the Athenians command
that I depart to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, Socrates,&rsquo; said Simmias, &lsquo;this is a strange piece of
advice, and one which Evenus is not likely to take.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why so,&rsquo; said Socrates, &lsquo;is he not a philosopher? Surely
he should be ready to go the road which I am going. Only
he must not kill himself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why do you say this?&rsquo; said
Cebes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will correct me,&rdquo; said Phaedo, turning to the company,
&ldquo;if I misrepresent anything that you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak on without fear,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;you seem to
have the memory of all the muses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phaedo resumed, &ldquo;Socrates said, &lsquo;You ask me why a man
may not kill himself? Well, there is first this reason that
we are as sentinels set at a post, which we must not leave until
we are bidden; then again if men be servants of the gods, as
seems likely, how can they withdraw from this service
without leave? Would you not be angry if one of your
servants were to do it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;&lsquo;but if we are the servants of the
gods, and therefore in the best guardianship, should we not
be sorry to quit it? If so, is it not for the foolish to desire
death and for the wise to regret it?&rsquo; &lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; replied
the Master, &lsquo;and if I did not expect when I depart
hence to go to the realms of the wise and good gods and to
the company of righteous men, I should indeed grieve at
death. And that I am right in so expecting let me now
seek to prove to you, for what better could I do on this the
last day of my life? But stay; Crito wishes to say some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>thing.
What is it?&rsquo; Crito said, &lsquo;He who has to give the
poison says that you must talk as little as possible, for that
if a man so excites himself he has to drink sometimes two
potions or even three.&rsquo; &lsquo;Let him take his course,&rsquo; said the
master, &lsquo;and prepare what he thinks needful. And now to
the matter in hand. Death, then, is nothing but a separation
of the soul from the body. That you concede. And
you concede further that a philosopher should care little for
the things of the body, and that when he is most free from the
body, then he sees most clearly the highest and best things,
perceiving, for instance, right and justice and honor and
goodness, veritable things all of them, but such as cannot
be discerned with the eyes or handled with the hands.
For the body with its desires and wants hinders us, and
makes us waste our time on the things that it covets, so that
we have neither time nor temper for wisdom. If then we
are ever to reach absolute Truth we must get rid of the
hindrance. While we live we do this to the best of our ability,
and he is the wisest man and best philosopher who does it
most completely; but wholly we cannot do it, till the god
shall liberate us from the control of this companion&mdash;And
this is done by Death, which is the complete separation
of soul and body. Shall then the philosopher, who has
all his life been striving for such partial separation as may
be possible, complain when the gods send him this separation
that is complete? And this is my defence, my friends,
for holding it to be a good thing to die.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied
Cebes, &lsquo;but many fear that when the soul is thus parted
from the body, it may be nowhere, being dissipated like a
breath or a puff of smoke when the body with which it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
been united dies.&rsquo; &lsquo;You desire, then,&rsquo; said Socrates, &lsquo;that
I should prove to you that the soul does not perish when it
is thus separated from the body?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; we all said, &lsquo;that
is what we all wish.&rsquo; &lsquo;First then,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;is it not
true that every thing implies that which is opposite to it, as
Right implies Wrong, and Fair implies Foul, and <i>to sleep</i> is
the opposite of <i>to wake</i>? If so does not <i>to die</i> imply its opposite
<i>to live again</i>?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Secondly, is it not true that the highest part of our
knowledge is a remembering again? For there are things
which we know not through our senses. How then do we
know them? Surely because we had this knowledge of
them at some previous time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Cebes, &lsquo;may it not be true that the soul has
been made beforehand to enter the body; and having
entered it lives therein, and yet perishes when its dwelling
is dissolved?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Being of a frail nature, I suppose,&rsquo; said the Master, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
all to be blown away by the wind, so that a man should be
especially afraid to die on a stormy day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this we all laughed, for we did laugh many times and
heartily that day, though now this may seem to others and
indeed to ourselves almost incredible, seeing what we were
about to lose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; the Master went on, &lsquo;I will seek to relieve you of
this fear. Is it not true that things that are made up of
parts are liable to be separated? And is it not also true that
the soul is not made up of parts, but is simple and not compounded?
Also it is visible things that perish; but the
soul is not visible. Again the soul is the ruler, and the body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the servant. Is it not true that the divine and immortal
rule the human and mortal senses?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To this we all agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Master began again, for he now, as I may say, had to
put before us the conclusion of the whole matter. &lsquo;We
may think thus, then, may we not? If the soul depart
from the body in a state of purity, not taking with it any of
the uncleannesses of the body, from which indeed it has
kept itself free during life as far as was possible&mdash;for this is
true philosophy&mdash;then it departs into that invisible region
which is of its own nature, and being freed from all fears
and desires and other evils of mortality, spends the rest of
its existence with the gods and the spirits of the good that
are like unto itself. But if it depart, polluted and impure,
having served the body, and suffered itself to be bewitched
by its pleasures and desires, then it cannot attain to this
pure and heavenly region, but must abide in some place that
is more fitted for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much else he said on this point to which we listened as
though it were another Orpheus that was singing to us.
And when he had ended and sat wrapt in thought, we were
silent, fearing to disturb him. And so we remained for no
little space of time in silence, he sitting on the bed, as if he
neither saw nor heeded any of the things that were about
him, and we regarded him most earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a while he woke up, as it were, from his reverie and
said, &lsquo;You have agreed with me so far; yet it may be that
you have yet fears and doubts in your minds which I have
not yet dispersed. If so let me hear them, that I may, if it
be possible, rid you of them, for indeed I cannot, as I conceive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
leave behind me a greater gift for you than such a riddance.
Speak then, if there is anything that you would say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simmias said&mdash;I put, you will perceive, his argument in a
few words: &lsquo;May it not be that the soul is in the body as a
harmony is in a harp? For the harmony is invisible and
beautiful and divine, and the harp is visible and material
and mortal. Yet when the harp perishes, then the harmony
also, of necessity, ceases to be.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Simmias had ended, Cebes began: &lsquo;I do indeed
believe that the soul is more durable than the body. Just
so; the wearer is more durable than the thing which he
wears. Yet at the last, one thing that he weaves proves to
be more durable than he. So may the soul outlast many
bodies, and yet perish finally, worn out, so to speak, by
having gone through so many births.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I put these things rightly, O Simmias and Cebes?&rdquo;
said the young philosopher, addressing them, &ldquo;though indeed
I have made them very brief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have put them rightly,&rdquo; the two agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we heard these things,&rdquo; Phaedo went on, &ldquo;we
were also greatly disturbed; for we desired to believe that
which the Master was seeking to prove, and seemed to have
attained certainly, and now we were thrown back again
into confusion and doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did the Master take it, O Phaedo?&rdquo; said Callias;
&ldquo;for indeed I feel much as you describe yourselves as having
felt. Having reached a certain hope, not to say conviction,
I am now disturbed by fears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more admirable than his behavior.
That he should be able to answer, was to be expected; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that he should receive these objections so sweetly, so gently,
and perceiving our dismay, quickly encourage us, and, so to
speak, reform our broken ranks&mdash;this indeed was beyond all
praise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I myself was sitting on a low seat by the side of his
bed. He dropped his hand, and stroked my head and
the hair which lay upon my neck, I wore it long in those
days,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> for he was often wont to play with my hair. Then
he said, &lsquo;I suppose, Phaedo, that you intend to cut off these
beautiful locks to-morrow, as mourners are wont to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose so,&rsquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you must cut them off to-day and not to-morrow if
our doctrine be stricken to death, and we cannot bring it to
life again.&rsquo; Then he turned to Simmias and Cebes, and
said, &lsquo;Hear now what I have to say, but while you hear,
think much of the truth but little of Socrates; and be on
your guard lest in my eagerness I deceive not myself only
but you also, and leave my sting behind me when I die
even as does a bee. You, Simmias, think that the soul may
be but as a harmony in the body. But do you not remember
what we said about all knowledge being a remembering, and
that what the soul knows it has before learnt? It existed
then before the body; but a harmony cannot exist before
the things are put together of which it proceeds. Then
again harmony may be more or less; but one soul cannot be
more a soul than another. And if, as the wise men say,
virtue is harmony and vice discord, we have a harmony of
a discord, which cannot be; finally one part of the soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
often opposes another, as reason opposes appetite; how then
is the soul a harmony? You, Cebes, hold, indeed, that the
soul is durable, but may not be immortal. Hear then my
answer. You believe that there are ideas or principles of
things, and that these ideas, being invisible, are the real
causes of things that are visible.&rsquo; Cebes acknowledged that
he did so believe. &lsquo;Is not now the soul the principle of life,
and is not this principle the opposite of death? In its
essence, therefore, it is immortal; but that which is immortal
cannot be destroyed, no, even though there are things
which seem to threaten its existence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this we all agreed. After this Socrates discoursed in
many words about the abodes and dwelling-places of the
dead both good and bad, and of the manner in which they
are dealt with by the powers thereunto appointed. But of
this I will speak on some other occasion, if you will. At
present time is short, for I must not leave the sick man any
longer, only I will relate the very end of the Master&rsquo;s discourse
and the things that happened after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To affirm positively about such matters,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is not
the part of a wise man. Yet what I have said seems reasonable.
And anyhow he who has scorned the body and its
pleasures during life, and has adorned the soul with her
proper virtues, justice and courage and truth, may surely
await his passage to the other world with a good hope. But
now destiny calls me, and I must obey. But I will bathe before
I take the poison, that the women may not have the
trouble of washing my body.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Crito asked: &lsquo;Have you any directions to give us?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing now; if you rightly order your own lives, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
will do the best for me and my children; but if you do not,
then whatever you may promise, you will fail.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; Crito asked, &lsquo;how shall we bury you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you will,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;provided only you can catch me
and that I do not slip out of your hands.&rsquo; Then he smiled,
and said, &lsquo;Crito here will not be persuaded that I am saying
the truth. He thinks that <i>I</i> am the dead body that he will
soon see here, and asks how he shall bury me. Assure him
then that when this dead body is laid in the grave or put
upon the pyre to be burnt it is not Socrates that he sees. For
to speak in this way, O Crito, is not only absurd but
harmful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this he bathed, remaining in the bath-chamber
for some time. This being ended, his children were brought
to him, and the women of his family also. With these he
talked awhile in the presence of Crito, and afterward commanded
that some one should take the women and children
away. And it was now near sunset. Hereupon the servant of
the Eleven came in, and said, &lsquo;O Socrates, you will not be
angry with me and curse me when I tell you, as the
magistrates constrained me to do, that you must drink the
poison. I have always found you most gentle and generous,
the best by far of all that have come into this place. You
will be angry, not with me, for you know that I am blameless,
but with those whom you know to be in fault. And
now, for you know what I am come to tell you, bear what
must be borne as cheerfully as may be.&rsquo; And saying this
the man turned away his face and wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; said Socrates, &lsquo;I will do as you bid,&rsquo; and
looking to us he said, &lsquo;How courteous he is! All the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
he has been so, sometimes talking to me, and showing himself
the best of fellows. And now see how generously he
weeps for me! But we must do what he says. Let some
one bring the poison, if it has been pounded; if not, let the
man pound it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Crito, &lsquo;the sun is still upon the mountains.
I have known some who would prolong the day
eating and drinking till it was quite late before they drank.
Anyhow do not be in a hurry. There is still plenty of
time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Socrates, &lsquo;these men were quite consistent.
They thought that they were gaining so much time. But I
too must be consistent. I believe that I shall gain nothing
by dying an hour or two later, except indeed the making of
myself a laughing stock by clinging to life when there is
really nothing left of it to cling to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Crito made a sign to the slave that was standing
by; he went out, and after some time had passed brought
in the man whose duty it was to give the poison, and who
brought it in ready mixed in a cup. When Socrates caught
sight of him, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, my friend, you know all about these matters.
What must I do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will only have to walkabout after you have drunk
the poison, till you feel a sort of weight in your legs. Then
you should lie down, and the poison will do the rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So saying, he reached the cup to the Master, who took
it. His hand did not shake; there was not the least change
in his color or his look. Only he put his head forward in
the way he had, and said to the man:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How about making a libation from the cup? May we
do it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Socrates,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;we pound just so much as we
think sufficient.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I understand,&rsquo; said the Master. &lsquo;Still we may, nay we
must, pray to the gods that my removal hence to that place
may be fortunate. The gods grant this! Amen!&rsquo; And as
he said this he put the cup to his lips and drank it off in the
easiest, quietest way possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to that time we had all been fairly well able to keep
from tears. But when we saw him drinking the poison,
when we knew that he had finished it, we could restrain
them no longer. As for myself I covered my face with my
mantle, and wept to myself. Not for him did I weep, but
for myself, thinking what a friend I had lost. And others
were still more overcome than I was. Only Socrates was
quite unmoved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why all this,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my dear friends? I sent the
women away for this very reason, that they might not vex
us in this fashion. I have heard it said that a man ought
to die with good words in his ears. Be quiet, I beseech, and
bear yourselves like men.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we heard this we were not a little ashamed of
ourselves, and kept back our tears. He walked about till he
felt the weight in his legs, and then lay down on his back&mdash;this
was what the man bade him do. Then the man who
administered the poison squeezed his foot pretty strongly,
and asked him whether he felt anything. He said no.
Then the man showed us how the numbness was going
higher and higher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When it reaches his heart,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he will die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the groin was cold the Master uncovered his face&mdash;for
he had covered it before&mdash;and said, &lsquo;Crito, we owe a
cock to &AElig;sculapius; pay it, do not forget.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These were the last words he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said Crito, &lsquo;is there anything more?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he made no answer. A little time after, we saw
him move. Then the man uncovered the face, and we saw
that his eyes were set. Then Crito closed his mouth and
his eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phaedo left the room hastily when he had finished his
narrative. For some time there was silence. Then Apollodorus
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, my friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am not very
wise nor at all learned; but he bore with me and my foolishness,
and you will also because you know I loved him. Let me
say then one thing. Much that Socrates said that day I did
not understand, nor do I understand it now when I hear it
again. Yet no one could be more fully persuaded than I
was that he spoke the truth. And what persuaded me was
the sight of the man. So brave was he, so cheerful, so
wholly convinced in his own mind, that no one could doubt
that he was indeed about to depart to a better place.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>THE CONDITION OF EXILE.</small></h2>


<p>The story that Callias had heard of the last days of his
Master, and heard, of course, with many details which it is
now impossible to reproduce, made, it need hardly be said,
a profound impression on him. First and foremost&mdash;and
this was what the dead man himself would have been most
rejoiced to see&mdash;was the profound conviction that this
teaching, inspired, as it was, with a faith which the immediate
prospect of death had not been able to shake, was absolutely
true. The young man can hardly be said to have
had any feeling of religion in the sense in which we understand
that word. To believe in the fables, grotesque or even
immoral, which made up the popular theology, in gods who
were only exaggerated men, stronger, indeed, but more
cruel, treacherous, and lustful, was an impossibility. The
poets&rsquo; tales of the Elysian plain and of the abyss of Tartarus
had in no wise helped towards producing any emotions of
the spiritual kind, any wish to dwell in an invisible world.
The most sacred of these poets in his description of that
world as another earth in which everything was feebler, paler,
less satisfying than it is here, had certainly repelled rather
than attracted him. Now this want had been supplied; the
lofty teaching of duty, duty owed to country, kinsfolk,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
friends, fellow-citizens, fellow-men, that he had heard from
the Master was now supplemented and sanctioned by this
clear enunciation of a doctrine of immortality. The young
man felt that he could face the world, whether it brought
him prosperity or adversity, joy or sorrow, life or death,
with a more equable soul or more assured spirit than he had
ever dreamed could be possible.</p>

<p>His immediate duty, however, was less clear. When his
country lay under the heel of the Spartan conqueror, Hermione
had pointed out to him&mdash;not without sacrifice of herself,
as he sometimes could not help feeling, what he owed
to the city that had given him birth. But now, how did
the case stand? Athens had suffered a second, a more fatal
fall. She might repair her losses; she might retrieve defeat.
But when she had definitely broken with right and
truth, had deliberately chosen the worse rather than the
better, what hope, what remedy was there? And what
was the obligation on himself? Could he aspire to a career
in a State which was so false to all the principles of life and
government?</p>

<p>The two or three days that followed the conversation related
in my last chapter were spent by the young Athenian
in debating with himself the question: What am I to do?
But the more he thought over the problem, the more complex
and intricate did it seem to become. Just when he
was beginning to despair, a solution, rude and peremptory,
but satisfactory in so far as it admitted of no questioning,
was forced upon him.</p>

<p>He had just risen on the morning of the fourth
day, when a visitor was announced. It was Xenophon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
looking, as Callias thought, serious, but not depressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have you been doing these three days?&rdquo;
cried the newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking,&rdquo; replied Callias.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I have been doing myself, and I
would wager my chance of being Archon next year, a very
serious stake indeed, that we have had the same subject for
our thoughts. You have been debating with yourself what
you are to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so; and I am no nearer a conclusion than I was
when I began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, some one else has been good enough to save us the
trouble of deciding. Listen to this. I have a friend in office,
I should tell you, and he has given me an early copy of
what will be soon known all over Athens. &lsquo;It is proposed
by Erasinides, son of Lysias, of the township of Colonus,
that Xenophon, son of Grythus, of the township of Orchia,
and Callias, son of Hipponicus, of the township of Eleusis,&rsquo;
and some twenty others, whose names I need not trouble
you with, &lsquo;be banished from Athens for unpatriotic conduct,
especially in aiding and abetting the designs of Cyrus,
who was a notorious enemy of the Athenian people.&rsquo;
Well; that is going to be proposed to the Senate to-day.
My friend, who knows all about the strings, and how they
are pulled, tells me that it is certain to be carried. In the
course of a few days it will be brought before the Assembly,
and I have no doubt whatever that it will be accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what have the Athenian people got to do with Cyrus,
who is dead and gone, and can neither help nor hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t understand. The Lacedaemonians, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
know, have declared war against the Persian King. Of
course that gives the Athenians a chance of becoming his
friends. It is true that things are not ripe just yet for anything
decisive or public. We are allies with the Lacedaemonians,
and can&rsquo;t venture to quarrel with them. But
this is a matter at which they cannot take offence, but
which will most certainly please the Great King. He has
not forgotten the Cyrus business, you may depend upon it,
and it will delight him to hear of any, who had a part in it
suffering for their act. That is why we are to be
banished. It is disgraceful, I allow, to find a great
city banishing its citizens in order to curry favor with the
barbarians; but it is a fact, and we must take it into
account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what shall you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go to Asia. I had intended to go in any case,
for I have private affairs there, nothing less important, I
may tell you in confidence, than marrying a wife. Then I
shall find something to do with the Spartans, among whom
I have some very good friends. Come with me. You too,
might find a wife; that will be as you please; but anyhow
I can guarantee you employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said Callias, after meditating awhile, &ldquo;that
I do not feel greatly drawn by what you suggest. As for
the wife, that prospect does not please me at all; and, as
you know, I am not so much of a Spartan-lover<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> as you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
You must let me think about it; you shall have a final
answer to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Xenophon had taken leave, Callias went straight
to Hippocles, and happened to arrive just as a messenger
was leaving the house with a note addressed to himself, and
asking for an early visit. Callias related what he had just
heard from Xenophon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not surprise me. In fact I also have had a
private intimation from a member of the Senate that this is
going to be done, and it is exactly the matter about which I
wished to see you. But tell me, what does Xenophon
advise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Callias told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you hesitate about accepting his offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I do more than hesitate; I feel more and more
averse to it the more I think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right; to take service with the Spartans must,
almost of necessity, mean, sooner or later, some collision
with your own country. It was this that ruined Alcibiades.
If he could only have had patience, he could have saved
himself and the Athenians too, but that visit to Sparta
ruined both. No; I should advise you against Xenophon&rsquo;s
suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where am I to go? I have thought of Syracuse.
But I do not care to go back to Dionysius. He was all
courtesy and kindness; but I felt suffocated in the air of his
court. And we never feel quite safe with a tyrant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of something else that might suit you.
I am going to start in a few days&rsquo; time on a visit to my own
native country, not to Poseidonia&mdash;I could not bear to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the barbarians masters there&mdash;but to Italy. There are other
Greek cities which still hold their own, and they are well
worth seeing. You might, too, if you choose, pay another
visit to Rome. You will at least have the advantage of
being out of this dismal round of strife to which Greece
itself seems doomed. Our countrymen there have, I know,
faults of their own; but they do contrive to live on tolerably
good terms with each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plan proposed seemed to Callias to promise better
than any that he could think of and he accepted the offer
with thankfulness. A few days afterwards he was gazing
for what he felt might well be the last time at the city of
his birth. Bathed in the sunshine of a summer morning
stood the Acropolis, crowned with its marble temples, and,
towering above all, the gigantic statue of Athene the Champion,
her outstretched spear-point flashing in the light.
What glories he was leaving behind him! What lost hopes,
what unfulfilled aspirations of his own! The tears of no
unmanly emotion were in his eyes as he turned away, but
not before he had caught sight of a well-known house by
the harbor of Piraeus. This seemed to be the last drop of
bitterness in his cup. She had lost him for his country&rsquo;s
sake, and now he had lost her, too. He turned and found
himself face to face with Hermione! There was something
in her look which made his heart thrill; but she did not
give him time to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Callias,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you gave up what you said was
dear to me,&rdquo; and her blush deepened as she spoke, &ldquo;for
Athens&rsquo; sake. But now&mdash;if you have not forgotten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He needed to hear no more. The next moment, careless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
of the eyes of the old helmsman, he had clasped her in his
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can allow myself to love the exile,&rdquo; she whispered in
his ear.</p>

<h2>Author&rsquo;s Postscript.</h2>


<p>It is impossible for the writer of historical fiction, especially
if he wishes to suggest to his readers as many subjects
of interest as possible, to adapt the literary necessities of his
work to fit in with the actual course of events. But he is
bound to point out such departures from historical accuracy
as he feels constrained to make. It is quite possible that
a correction may serve to impress the real facts upon his
readers more deeply than an originally accurate statement
would have done. I therefore append to my tale a list of</p>


<h4><i>CORRIGENDA.</i></h4>

<p>1. I was anxious to include the Battle of Arginus&aelig; in
my story. It was the first scene in the last act of the great
drama of the Peloponnesian war. At the same time I felt
bound, having made up my mind to give a description of a
Greek comedy, to choose the <i>Frogs</i>. It has a literary interest
such as no other Aristophanic play possesses, and it is at
once more important and more intelligible to a modern
reader. But to bring the two things together it was necessary
to ante-date the representation of the play. I have put
it in the year 406 B. C. It really took place in 405. I have
also made the battle happen somewhat earlier than in all
probability, it really did. The festival of the Great Dionysia,
at which new plays were produced, was celebrated in March.
We do not know precisely the date of Arginus&aelig;, but it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
likely that it was later in the year. A similar correction
must be made about the embassy of Dionysius. It may
have taken place when the play was really produced, but in
406 Dionysius was too busy with his war with Carthage to
think of such things.</p>

<p>2. I have ante-dated, this time by several years, the capture
of Poseidonia by the native Italians. Here again we
have no record of the precise time; but it probably happened
somewhat later in the century.</p>

<p>3. I do not know whether I am wrong in making Alcibiades
escape from his castle in Thrace immediately after the
battle &AElig;gos Potami. Plutarch would give one rather to
understand that he fled after the capture of Athens. It is
quite possible, however, that he recognized the defeat as
fatal to Athenian influence of the Thracian coast, and that
feeling his own position to be no longer tenable, he retired
from it at once.</p>

<p>4. I have taken some liberties with the text of Xenophon&rsquo;s
narrative. The trial of the generals by their own soldiers,
the athletic sports, and the entertainment described in my
story are all taken from the <i>Anabasis</i>, but they do not come
so close together as I have found it convenient to put them.</p>

<p>5. It is a moot point among historians whether Xenophon
returned to Athens after he had quitted the Ten
Thousand. Mr. Grote thinks that he did; and his authority
is perhaps sufficient to shelter such a humble person as myself.
It has also been debated whether he was banished in
399 or some years later. I am inclined to think that here I
am accurate.</p>

<p>6. I need hardly say that the Thracian national song is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
of my own invention. Xenophon simply says that the
Thracian performers went off the stage singing the &ldquo;Sitalces.&rdquo;
That this was a song celebrating the achievement of the
king of that name (for which see a classical dictionary) cannot
be doubted. But we know nothing more about it, and I
have supplied the words.</p>

<p>7. It is not necessary to say that the &ldquo;diary&rdquo; of Callias
is an invention. To be quite candid I do not think it was
at all likely that a young soldier would have kept one, or
even been able to write it up daily. But I wanted to give
some prominent incidents from Xenophon&rsquo;s story, and had
not space for the whole, while a mere epitome would have
been tedious.</p>

<p>8. I must caution my readers against supposing my hero
to be historical. There was a Callias, son of Hipponicus, at
this time, a very different man.</p>

<p>9. I have taken the defence of Socrates from Plato&rsquo;s
<i>Apology</i>, not from Xenophon. The former is immeasurably
superior.</p>

to much more in actual value). These were originally equivalents
for special privileges and powers which the wealthy enjoyed under the
earlier constitution, but they were continued in force after the democratic
changes which put all citizens on an equality. The Aliens were
not liable to all.</p></div>

sit (as had been the practice in the heroic ages) lay on his left side, supporting
his head by his left arm, the other arm being left free to help
himself from the dishes when they were placed before him. Women
and children always sat at table.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Hippocles is alluding to a well known story. Midas deciding in
favor of Pan as a better musician than Apollo was punished by being
given the long ears of an ass. He hid them under his Thurgian cap
from all men except the barber who cut his hair. This man, oppressed
with the secret, dug a hole in the earth, whispered into it, &ldquo;King Midas
has asses&rsquo; ears,&rdquo; and filling it up again, so found relief from his burden.
But a reed grew from the spot, and as it was moved by the wind whispered
the secret to the world.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The instances in which a Spartan general sent to fill some office
abroad seemed to lose all self-restraint and all sense of shame are deplorably
numerous. Pausanias, the Spartan who commanded at Plat&aelig;a,
and was afterwards banished for treacherous dealings with the Persians,
was the first conspicuous example of this national failing, as it may be
called; but it was an example often followed. The Spartan governors
in allied or conquered cities were almost proverbial for profligacy,
tyranny and corruption.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> A seaman was paid four obols a day, the rate having been increased
by the liberality of Cyrus from three to four. Five obols went to the
drachma, and a hundred drachmas to the mina.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> This was the prince commonly called the younger Cyrus, the second
of the two sons of Darius Nothus, King of Persia, by his Queen
Parysatis. He had come down about a year and a half before the time
of which I am writing to take the government of a large portion of Asia
Minor, viz: Lydia, Phrygia, and Cappadocia. He was strongly pro-Spartan
in his views, and as has been explained in a previous note, had
increased the rate furnished by the Persian treasury to the Spartan
fleet. But Lysander, in his anger at being suspended in the command,
had, with the selfishness, characteristic of Spartan officers, paid back
to Cyrus all the money that had been furnished for the pay of the
sailors.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Phormion won some brilliant victories in the Corinthian gulf in the
early years of the war. He died prematurely, it would seem about
429 B. C.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The number of triremes contributed by Athens to the Greek fleet of
Salamis was one hundred and eighty, but this comprised, of course,
literally every ship that they possessed. In the expedition against
Syracuse, the triremes numbered one hundred and thirty-four.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Diomedon was the officer in command of Samos, and had already
attempted with the twelve ships that composed his squadron, to relieve
Conon. His force was so inferior to that of the Spartans that he could
only have hoped to succeed by eluding their observations. Accordingly
he had avoided the harbors and endeavored to make his way up a narrow
channel, known by the common name of &ldquo;Euripus&rdquo; (a channel
with a swift current) by which Mitylene could be approached. Callicratidas,

where the same system almost led to disaster. It was only by the unusual
personal influence of Miltiades, a personal influence almost unparalleled
in Athenian history, that thus the ten generals were induced
to fight at Marathon. There can be little doubt that, if the conflict
had been delayed the pro-Persian party might have seriously hampered,
if it did not altogether defeat, the efforts of the patriots.</p></div>

might have been made, and the ruin of Athens probably postponed for

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> There were three original moods in Greek music, the Dorian,
Phrygian, and Lydian. The last of these was in a major scale, and was
reckoned to be plaintive and effeminate. So Milton writes in <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i>.
</p><p class="poem">
&ldquo;And ever against eating cares<br />
Lap one in soft Lydian airs<br />
Married to immortal verse;<br />
Such as the melting soul may pierce<br />
In notes with many a winding bout<br />
Of linked sweetness long drawn out.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p>
The Dorian was in a minor scale, and was considered to be manly
and vigorous. Martial music was of this kind. So, to quote Milton
again, we have:
</p><p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">&ldquo;Anon they move</span><br />
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood<br />
Of flutes and soft melodies; such as raised<br />
To heights of noblest temper heroes old<br />
Coming to battle.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p>
The third, or Phrygian, was also minor, and was considered to be
suitable for sacrifices and other religious functions as being of an ecstatic
kind. There were combinations and modifications of these moods.

had a division of time that was so named. But it must not be supposed
that these hours were exact periods of time such as we mean by the
word. The day between sunrise and sunset was divided into twelve
equal parts, which varied in length according to the season of the year.
The divisions of the whole period of a day and night into twenty-four
equal unvarying parts was later than the period of which I am writing,
being attributed to Hipparchus, the astronomer, a native of Nic&aelig;a in
Bithynia who lived in the second century B. C. The water-clock
mentioned in the text may have been one of those large ones which
served for the whole night (Plato is said to have had one). The slave in
announcing to the guest the time at which the meal would be served
would probably indicate it by pointing to this or that division marked
upon it. The water-clock may be roughly compared to a sand-glass, but
the water flowed through several orifices, which were very minute.</p></div>

with some explanation. When he drank the fatal cup he threw the
dregs on the floor with the peculiar jerk given in playing the game of
Cottabos. This game had several forms; but the feature common to
them all was the heaving of wine out of a cup. Sometimes the object
seems to have been a kind of fortune telling. A guest when he had
finished his cup would jerk out any dregs that might be left. At the
same time he named the guest who was to drink next, and the sound
made by the drops falling was supposed to give some omen good or bad.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
